                            new car, home improvements, wedding or emergency expense.</p>

                        </p>

                        <h2>Guarantor Loans Lenders</h2>

                        <p>Below is a list of guarantor lenders that we work with. Simply click

                            on the lender of your choice for more information about their criteria

                            and the loans that they offer. You can click through to the lender’s

                            page where you will be able to apply directly on their website.</p>

                        <p>(The list of guarantor lenders)</p>
                        <h2>How the application works for a Guarantor Lender</h2>

                        <p>The main criteria with the guarantor lenders that we feature is that

                            you must be over 18 years of age, a UK resident and earn a minimum

                            income of at least £600 per month. Above all, you require a person to

                            be your guarantor such a family member, friend, spouse or colleague

                            who agrees to repay your loan for you in the event that you cannot

                            meet the repayments.</p>

                        <p>When you apply through one of our guarantor lenders, you will be

                            required to enter your details on their application form including

                            your name, address, employment, income and bank details. You will

                            also be required to provide details about your guarantor.</p>

                        <p>Both the borrower and the guarantor will be required to sign a pre-

                            contract agreement confirming their responsibilities and how the

                            guarantor loan works. In some cases, the lender might send a code by

                            SMS to both parties which can be used as a way of signing the loan

                            agreement online.</p>
                        <h2>The checks carried out by Guarantor Lenders</h2>

                        <p>There are several <a href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/guarantor-loans/types-of-checks-that-guarantor-lenders-do">checks carried out by guarantor lenders</a> which

                            include a basic phone call to both the borrower and the guarantor. It

                            is essential that the guarantor understand their responsibility, as

                            they may need to cover the cost of the borrower’s loan.

                            In addition, the guarantor lender will run credit checks on both

                            parties and this is an essential procedure. <a href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/guarantor-loans">Guarantor loans</a> are

                            popular for those with bad credit or no credit and have been denied

                            elsewhere. By having a guarantor with a good credit rating, it shows

                            that they have a history of paying loans on time so the lender feels

                            confident that they will be able to retrieve their repayments.

                            Therefore, the better the credit rating of your guarantor, the more

                            likely your loan will be approved.</p>
                        <p>
                            Further affordability checks will be carried out in order to match

                            what the applicants wants to borrow with how much they can afford

                            to repay. Guarantor lenders will look closely at the levels of income

                            when making their decision but they have to be careful not to lend

                            the borrower too much or they will fall into arrears.
                        </p>

                        <h2>When will I receive my funds?</h2>

                        <p>
                            The companies on our website are able to transfer funds within 1 to

                            3 working days, depending on the lender. When a loan application is

                            successful, the monies are transferred to the guarantor’s bank

                            account who can decide to pass on the loan to the borrower or

                            change their mind and give the money back to the lender.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How do the repayments work? </h2>

                        <p>Repayments are made in equal monthly instalments and will be

                            collected from the borrower’s debit account. If payment fails, the

                            lender will contact the borrower but if there is no response for a

                            certain period, the repayments may be taken out of the guarantor’s

                            bank account.
                        </p>

                            a mutual interest with our lenders because we want to provide our

                            customers with the best lenders and they are readily looking for

                            customers to approve.
