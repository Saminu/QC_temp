            <h2>Logbook loans are secured on your vehicle</h2>
            <p>Logbook loans or ‘log book loans’ refer to borrowing up to £50,000 secured on

                your vehicle. Whether it’s your car, motorbike or van, you are asked to supply

                the lender with a ‘log book’ (V5 registration document) or MOT certificate for

                security. Borrowers will be asked to sign a form known as the ‘Bill of Sale’,

                which means that the lender will own your vehicle on a temporary basis. You

                are still able to use the car as normal so long as you meet all the monthly loan

                repayments. However, if you fail to repay the loan on the dates agreed, the bill of

                sale means that the lender can repossess your car without a court order.</p>

            <p>Logbook loans are popular for those with bad credit who may have been turned

                down for loans by traditional banks or lenders. By providing their car as security,

                it gives the lender more confidence that they can recover the cost if the borrower

                is unable to meet repayment. Borrowers must be aware that failing to meet

                repayment will lead to the repossession of their car and additional charges in

                order to repurchase it.</p>

            <p>Our comparison table allows you to clearly compare the cost, duration and

                amount that you can borrow from different logbook loan companies in the UK.

                You can borrow up to £50,000 depending on the value of your motor vehicle and

                repay over 2 to 5 years in weekly or monthly instalments. You can receive funds

                directly into your bank account in one lump sum on the same day or the same

                week depending on the lender.</p>
            <p>When you apply with one of our featured lenders, you will be asked to enter

                details about your car and its value. To be eligible, you need to own a vehicle

                worth more than £500 and have no outstanding finance on it, depending on

                the loan vendor. The value of the vehicle determines how much you are able to

                borrow and lenders will typically lend up to 50% of its value. You will also be

                required to have other details of your car handy to prove that you are the owner,

                also known as the ‘Registered Keeper.’</p>
            <h2>Apply for car logbook loans online</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, one could obtain car logbook loans from various companies

                and dealerships in your local area. There are lots of places in Manchester and

                Liverpool where you can arrange an appointment to value your car, show your

                documents and sign the agreement in person.</p>
            <p>However, it’s a lot more convenient and practical to apply for logbook loan

                online. You can apply from anywhere using your desktop, mobile or tablet as

                long as you have access to the Internet. Applying online gives you more choice

                – our comparison table allows you to compare the rates of several different

                lenders at once. The companies we feature can process the entire application

                online from entering the details about your vehicle and signing the loan

                agreements electronically. All correspondence is handled via email or SMS so

                you don’t have to post any documents off and wait for an answer. All the checks

                can be run electronically, giving you an instant decision as to whether you have

                been successful or not. Provided that you meet the lender’s criteria, you can

                receive a same day logbook loan and the funds will be transferred to your bank

                account immediately.</p>

            <h2>What vehicles can you use for a logbook loan?</h2>
            <h3>Logbook loans for vans</h3>
            <p> The lenders we feature will be able to offer you a logbook loan for vans and

                camper vans. However, if your van is your source of commuting to work or

                living arrangement, you must be very aware of the potential risks of this type of

                finance. By agreeing to a logbook loan, you agree to use your van as collateral

                and this can be repossessed by the lender if you default on payments.</p>
            <h3>Logbook loans for motorbike</h3>
            <p>Similarly, if you want a logbook loan for motorbikes and use this type of vehicle

                for commuting to work or because its part of your work, you must be sure

                to read the terms and conditions carefully. You will need to be the owner of

                the vehicle so it cannot belong to your company and you must not have any

                outstanding finances on the bike. Furthermore, failing to repay on time means

                that your motorbike could risk repossession and this will affect your ability to go

                to work and generate income.</p>
            <h3>Logbook loans for old cars</h3>
            <p>
                Even if your vehicle is a few years old, you can still get a logbook loan for old

                cars. Lenders tend to favour newer cars because they are worth more and this

                will also increase the amount you are able to borrow. Some lenders will be very

                strict on how old the car is e.g 7 years, 8 years old etc. However, you can shop

                around and use the loan calculator on each of our featured lenders to see how

                much you will be able to borrow based on your old car.
