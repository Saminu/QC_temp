                    <h2> What are payday loans?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Payday loans refer to borrowing up to £2,500 from an online lender and

                        repaying on your next pay date. The money is transferred to your bank account

                        in one lump sum and the borrower must repay the loan amount and interest

                        when their salary next goes into their account, usually the last Friday of the

                        month.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Depending on the lender, first time customers can borrow up to £500 but once you have

                        repaid a loan successfully, you can borrow as much as £2,500, depending on the lender.

                        <a href="https://paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk/payday-loans/how-much-can-i-borrow" target="_blank">The amount you can borrow</a> will depend on a number of factors including your credit

                        history, income and the lender’s criteria.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since the loan will be repaid on your next pay date, a typical payday loan will last

                        7, 14 or 21 days but some lenders will allow you to repay up to 45 days later or

                        repay over 3,6 or 12 months in instalments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Repayments are made automatically by the lender on each pay date using a

                        process known as <a target='_blank' href='//www.fca.org.uk/news/continuous-payment-authorities-your-right-to-cancel'>Continuous Payment Authority</a>. This allows lenders to collect

                        repayments from your debit card in one smooth transaction so you don’t have to

                        worry about making a manual payment on your pay date.
                    </p>

                        account on the same day.

                    <h2> What is the criteria for applying?</h2>

                    <p>The criteria for payday loans will vary between lenders but the general requirements are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>UK resident</p></li>
                        <li><p>Over 18 years of age</p></li>
                        <li><p>Working debit account</p></li>
                        <li><p>Working mobile phone and email account</p></li>
                        <li><p>Full time or part time employed with minimum take-home of £500 pm</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        An online application will only take around 5 minutes to complete and once you

                        have filled in all your details, the <a target="_blank" href="https://paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk/payday-loans/how-does-a-payday-loan-application-work">
                        lenders will carry out a series of a checks</a> to see if you are eligible for a loan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most lenders require a certain credit score or affordability prior to approving a

                        loan. You may be required to confirm some details over the phone and verify

                        your employment by providing a copy of your pay-slip or bank statement. By

                        checking your salary, the lender can match up how much you wish to borrow

                        with what you can afford to repay and therefore find the best loan product for

                        you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a minimum credit score and level of affordability is required, there are

                        also lenders who offer bad credit payday loans and for those people on benefits.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you application has been successful, the funds can usually be transferred to

                        your debit account electronically within one hour, one day or 48 hours.
                    </p>



                    <h2>What are the reasons for taking out a payday loan?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Payday loans are typically used for short-term emergency expenses. So if you have a

                        broken down car, an expensive medical bill or a boiler on the brink but you don’t have

                        enough money that month to cover the cost, the idea is that the loan will help tide you

                        over until payday. So when you next receive your income from work, you can repay

                        your loan and be in a better financial position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you need money because of something urgent, you need the money fast so you

                        can understand why borrowers in the UK look for payday loans online where you can

                        receive funds within the hour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is best to have money saved away for a ‘rainy day’ and this usually involves

                        having around 3 to 6 months of your salary saved in a bank account or a safe

                        place and only using it for emergency purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we appreciate it is not always easy to save money and especially when

                        you have an emergency which comes from out the blue, you sometimes need a

                        little extra finance to help you through the month. With Quiddi Compare, you can

                        assess your options and compare the different rates offered by lenders and for

                        how long, allowing you to make an informed decision on your loan.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why is it important to compare payday loans?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Borrowers can save a lot of money if they compare payday loans effectively. This is

                        because all payday lenders have different rates of interest and terms of the loans that

                        they offer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recent studies carried out by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-proposals-to-lower-payday-loan-costs">Competition Market Authority</a> showed

                        would typically apply with the same lender over and over not realizing that there are

                        cheaper alternatives available. By finding a cheaper payday loan, the average customer

                        could save over £100 a year. Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/payday-lending-market-investigation">Gov.uk</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Payday lenders offer their rates in the form of APR and this refers to the Annual

                        Percentage Rate. It might be confusing that the percentage is in the thousands but this is

                        because APR is based on the payday loan as if it were taken out for an entire year and

                        therefore has been multiplied. APR is the consistent measure of interest of all loan and

                        financial product so it serves as a useful comparison tool.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other ways to compare payday loans involves looking at the daily interest rate that has

                        been capped at 0.8% per day or the cost per £100 that has been capped at £124. Please

                        also use the repayment examples we have provided to give you a better idea of what

                        you would repay. Any repayment example below this price cap suggests a very

                        competitive rate. You can read more here about <a target="_blank" href="https://paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk/payday-loans/understanding-the-costs-of-a-payday-loan">understanding the costs of payday

                        loans</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When using a payday loan comparison tool like ours, you should be able to find a lender

                        that suits what you are looking for – whether you want to repay over a longer period of

                        time or if you need to find a lender that can transfer funds immediately.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The best payday loan lenders are those that carry out affordability and credit

                        checks, handle your data securely and allow you to repay your loan early. So if

                        you decide that you have the funds earlier than your pay date and are ready to

                        repay sooner, you have the flexibility to do so and save money in the process.

                        This is because you will only be charged the daily interest that you have

                        accumulated up to that point. To give an example, if you have a 30 day loan and

                        decide to pay after 20 days, you will only pay 20 days worth of interest and

                        therefore not have to pay the full amount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using a comparison site, you may also find new payday lenders that have just

                        entered the market and offer more competitive rates. We are always looking to

                        feature new lenders and partners on our website so they can offer competitive

                        rates for our customers.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What if my application is not successful?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your application with one of our chosen lenders is not successful, your details

                        will not be sold on to any other third party companies and no fees will be

                        deducted from your account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Borrowers must be vary of applying with too many lenders because every time

                        you do, the company will run a credit check and this will leave a footprint on

                        your credit file for around 12 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So if you make too many applications in a short space of time, it will negatively

                        impact your credit rating and show other lenders that you are in desperate need

                        of cash.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When applying, always provide accurate and correct information, as you may be

                    <h2>What happens if you cannot repay?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you cannot make your loan repayment on time, there is usually a one-off

                        default fee charged by the lender which is a maximum of £15. In addition, a mark

                        will be left on your credit file stating that you have missed repayment – so this

                        could affect your ability to access credit in the future.

                        Lenders are required to offer forbearance and flexibility so always get in touch

                        quickly if you know that you are not going to be able to repay on time. Several of

                        the good companies we deal with will allow you delay your repayment or set up

                        an arrangement to pay lower amounts without damaging your credit score. <a target='_blank' href='https://paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk/payday-loans/implications-of-non-repayment-for-payday-loans'>Read

                        Some vendors will offer rollovers whereby your extend your loan, but this can

                        get expensive very quickly so only pursue this if you have considered how you

                        are going to pay off the debt.

                        Payday loans can be an expensive form of finance and should only be taken out

                        for genuine emergencies and not to fund a material lifestyle. Borrowers should

                        always consider how they are going to repay their loan before applying.

                    <h3>What payday loan alternatives are available?</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are several alternatives available where you can borrow up to £2,500.

                        Whilst these may seem cheaper, they may require you to put something down as

                        collateral or you may have to wait longer to receive your funds.

                        One of the smartest and most affordable alternatives to payday loans is

                        borrowing from a credit union. With a typical APR of 26.8%, these not-for-profit

                        organizations allow you to borrow a few hundred pounds at low rates. However,

                        to be eligible to borrow from your local credit union, you must have a job in the

                        public sector such as teacher, nurse or policeman. Also, the funds may take

                        between 1-2 weeks to be transferred to your account.

                        <a target='_blank' href='https://quiddicompare.co.uk/guarantor-loans'>Guarantor loans</a> allow you to borrow up to £7,500 for as long as 5 years

                        provided that you have an extra person involved in the transaction to act as your

                        ‘guarantor.’ This person is likely to be a close family member, colleague or friend

                        and they will agree to cover the cost of your loan if you cannot. With an APR of

                        around 49.9%, this product is ideal for those with bad credit as the borrower is

                        able to benefit from their partner’s credit rating in order to get the funds they

                        need.

                        <a target='_blank' href='https://quiddicompare.co.uk/logbook-loans'>Logbook loans</a> enable you to release the equity from your vehicle in order to

                        borrow money. By putting your car, van or bike down as collateral, this secured

                        loan lets you borrow up to £50,000 and repay in monthly instalments over 3

                        years, but you risk the repossession of your vehicle if you are unable to keep up

                        with repayments.

                        Credit cards are one of the most popular and simplest ways to borrow money. By

                        receiving a ‘credit limit’ based on your financial circumstances, you are able to

                        borrow a certain amount and repay the balance at end of the month – so it is like

                        a loan because you are getting the money up front. However, you must be

                        conscious about paying on time because the cost of going into your overdraft can

                        be more expensive than a payday loan. Source: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/10376952/Bank-overdrafts-as-expensive-as-payday-loans.html'>The Telegraph</a>.
