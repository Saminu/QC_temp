                        <h2>Things which do not affect your credit score</h2>
                        <p>
                        Your credit score is a numerical value that highlights your credit worthiness and

                        is used by creditors when deciding whether to grant you a financial product or

                        not. UK citizens check their credit score regularly because it can go and up down

                        depending on your financial circumstances. So many people monitor the results

                        to maximum their chances of being approved for loans and to get the best

                        interest rates possible. Typically, individuals will try to ensure their bills and

                        repayments are made on time to maintain a healthy credit score.</p>

                        <p>But surprisingly, there are many everyday transactions and payments that

                            people are conscience of but do not actually affect your credit score, as

                            highlighted below:</p>

                        <h2>Gas, water and electricity bills</h2>

                        <p><a target="_blank" href="//www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/paying-utility-bills-improve-credit.asp">Failing to pay your utility bills</a> does not have an impact on your credit score

                            despite common belief. Energy companies don’t see the need to report the

                            information back to credit reference agencies because it is timely and expensive.

                            However, failing to pay your bills on time will show on your credit report that

                            can be accessed by potential loan companies.</p>
                        <p>
                            Sadly, paying these bills on time doesn’t better your score like a credit card

                            would. Of course, it is advisable to pay these bills on time to avoid late fees,

                            negative marks on your credit report and to ensure the energy companies don’t

                            turn off your supply.
                        </p>


                        <h2>Rent</h2>

                        <p>Paying your rent on time or missing your monthly rent will not affect your credit

                            score because landlords won’t pass on the information to credit bureaus like

                            Experian or Equifax. But it is common for landlords to check your credit score

                            though beforehand because they want to know if you are likely to be a good

                            tenant.</p>


                        <h2>Mobile phone bills do not affect your credit score</h2>

                        <p>Most people think that not paying your mobile phone bill will negatively impact

                            your credit score but this is not actually the case. Missing your monthly phone

                            payment will show up negatively on your credit report and this information can

                            be accessed by lenders and creditors when deciding whether to provide you with

                            a loan. However, not paying your phone bill on time will not make your credit

                            score go up or down.</p>


                        <p>If you paid for your mobile phone bill via your credit card but that monthly bill is

                            not paid, this will negatively affect your credit score. Mobile phone vendors may

                            check your credit report and credit score before providing you with a phone

                            contract.</p>

                        <h2>Prepaid Cards are cards that will not alter your credit score</h2>

                        <p>Whilst applying for credit cards and how well you pay them will indeed make

                            your credit score go up and down, this is not the case with a prepaid card. With

                            the latter, it is simply a case of adding money onto the card up front, so how you

                            use it after that will have no impact on your credit score.</p>
                        <h2>Council Tax does not change your credit score</h2>

                        <p>The payment status of your council tax does not make a difference to your credit

                            score because the councils do not report this information to credit agencies. <a target="_blank" href="//www.experian.co.uk/consumer/questions/askjames226.html">The

                            Experian website quotes</a> that ‘non-payment of tax is treated as a criminal not a

                            civil matter. Fines (for late repayment) do not show on credit reports either.’</p>

                        <h2>Soft searches and inquiries</h2>

                        <p>Soft searches are when lenders check your credit report but the ‘footprint’ left is

                            not visible. When lenders are underwriting an applicant, they will do a hard

                            search on an individual’s credit report and this will be visible for up to 12

                            months. Having too many hard searches can make you an unattractive person to

                            lend to because it looks like you have made a lot of applications in a short space

                            of time and might seem desperate. So if hard searches are used on the individual,

                            soft searches are sometimes used by lenders to check the spouses or the

                            guarantor of the applicant. This way they can still get a good idea of their overall

                            financial circumstances without leaving any visible tracks.</p>
