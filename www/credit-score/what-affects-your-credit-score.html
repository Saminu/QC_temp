                        <h2>What affects your credit score?</h2>

                        <p>Your credit score is a number ranging from 0-999 that gives an indication of your

                            financial circumstances. High credit scores (721 – 999) suggest a customer has a

                            good repayment history compared to those with low credit scores (720 and

                            lower).</p>

                        <p>Consumers will try to maintain a high credit score in order to increase their

                            chances of being approved for loans especially since the best interest rates are

                            available for those with the best credit scores. Your credit score can constantly

                            go up and down based on a number of factors:</p>

                        <h2>Being on the electoral roll</h2>

                        <p>Being signed up to the electoral can improve your credit score because it

                            confirms your identity and address. Since a credit score is used in order to apply

                            for credit cards and loans, it helps lenders to underwrite your application

                            knowing that your name and address have been officially confirmed with the

                            local authorities.</p>

                        <h2>Having some credit history</h2>

                        <p>It is important to have some credit history for a healthy credit score. You can

                            have a credit score once you are 18 but as soon as you start, you have no credit

                            history and this can make it hard for companies to determine your credit risk.

                            This is why having a few cards and accounts open allows you to build up credit

                            and have a truly worthy score.</p>

                        <h2>Number of loans and searches</h2>

                        <p>Having too many loans open and a high debt-to-income ratio can cause your

                            credit score to go down as it makes you look financially stretched. Typically,

                            lenders may avoid granting finance to those with too many loans already open.

                            In certain industries, such as <a target="_blank" href="//paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk/">payday loans</a>, lenders may not be able to lend to

                            individuals that have more than a certain number open.</p>

                        <p>On a similar note, every time you apply for a loan, a lender may check your credit

                            record leaving a ‘hard search’ or ‘footprint’ as they search your file. However,

                            making too many loan applications in a short space of time negatively affects

                            your credit score as it suggests the individuals is in desperate need for finance.</p>

                        <h2>Paying loans and credit cards on time</h2>

                        <p>The most important factor that can impact your credit score is your ability to

                            repay loans and credit card repayments on time. Whether its personal loans,

                            mortgages or debit cards, keep up with payments allows you to maintain a good

                            credit score and if you have a low score, you are able to rebuild it.</p>

                        <p>In comparison, failing to make repayments on time causes your credit score to

                            fall. Since the information is sent to credit reference agencies, the information

                            that you have missed repayments is therefore available to other lenders who will

                            know that you may not be in a financial position to accept further finance.</p>

                        <h2>Bankruptcy and CCJ</h2>

                        <p>If you have ever experienced bankruptcy, it will drastically affect your credit

                            score and stay on your credit file for up to 10 years. A County Court Judgement is

                            a legal preceding where you confirm and write-off your debt. However, this

                            outcome is visible on your credit file for 6 years or until you pay off the debt and

                            this brings down your credit score.</p>

                        <h3>Married to someone with bad credit</h3>

                        <p>Finally, having a spouse with bad credit will not affect your credit score.

                            However, having joint accounts or mortgages will require you to use the credit

                            score of your partner so having a spouse with a very low credit score may

                            restrict you from obtaining loans and ones with the best rates.</p>
