                        <h2>Ways to improve your credit score</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are several ways to improve your credit score because it can constantly go

                            up or down based on your financial circumstances.</p>

                        <p>There are several advantages to having a good credit score because it vastly

                            improves your chances of being approved for financial products. In particular,

                            those applying for a mortgage need to have a good credit score to prove that they

                            are able to make repayments on time. Those with better credit ratings usually

                            have access to the best rates of interest because lenders consider them less likely

                            to default on repayment. In addition, individuals that have a bad credit history

                            have the opportunity to change their circumstances and can use the methods

                            below to rebuild their credit rating.  The best ways to boost your credit score are

                            explained below:</p>

                        <h2>Join the electoral roll</h2>

                        <p>Joining the electoral roll is the simplest way to improve your credit score fast. By

                            registering yourself to vote, you have to confirm your name, date of birth and

                            address with the local authorities. This information will be visible on a standard

                            credit check run by a credit card or loan provider. So for a lender deciding

                            whether to grant you a loan, they feel more confident knowing that your identity

                            and address has been officially confirmed. <a target="_blank" href="//www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">You can join the electoral roll here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Pay loans and cards on time</h2>
                        <p>
                            Paying loans and cards on time is essential to improve your credit score. By

                            repaying on time, it shows that you are a trustworthy person to lend to. If your

                            credit score is already high, paying on time will allow you to maintain a high

                            credit score. If your credit score is low or in the middle, every payment you make

                            on a time will contribute to increasing your credit score. This is because

                            whenever a payment is made to the provider, the information is sent to one of

                            the three main credit reference agencies Experian, Equifax and CallCredit and

                            updates your credit score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By comparison, failing to repay credit on time will also be reported back to the

                            credit reference agencies and this will worsen your credit score. So it is

                            important to pay on time to keep your credit score in tact.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Avoid making too many applications</h2>

                        <p>You credit score can fall if you make too many loan or card applications within a

                            short space of time. This is because several applications make the individual look

                            desperate for money and suggests financial difficulty. For this reason, some

                            lenders will avoid lending to people who have too many applications on their

                            credit file.</p>


                        <h2>Build up some credit history</h2>

                        <p>Sometimes having no credit history can work against you when applying for

                            financial products. This is particularly the case of young people who may never

                            have had a credit card or loan before. If you have no credit history, lenders

                            cannot tell whether you are a good person to lend to or not. Therefore, to help

                            your credit score, it can be good to apply for a credit card with a small credit

                            limit and get used to making regular payments on time to show lenders that you

                            are good borrower. When applying for a mortgage, lenders like to see a history of

                            transactions to get a better idea of your creditworthiness.</p>
                        <h2>Rebuild your credit</h2>

                        <p>There are specific financial products that can help you rebuild your credit score.

                            Guarantor loans are available to those with poor credit provided that you have a

                            guarantor with a better credit rating. The idea is that the guarantor helps you get

                            the loan because of their good credit and they agree to cover the cost of the loan

                            if you cannot repay. However, a guarantor loan gives you the opportunity to

                            prove your creditworthiness and since every repayment made on time is

                            updated on your account, you are able to improve your credit rating.</p>


                        <p>Similarly, one can apply for credit building credit cards that are designed

                            specifically to help you better your credit score if you pay on time. This type of

                            product can help because if you pay your card on time, you won’t have to pay any

                            interest and you may get an introductory bonus such as nectar points. A card

                            may be more suitable to build your credit rating compared to a loan where you

                            will have to pay interest to rebuild your credit score.</p>

                        <h2>Check your credit score</h2>

                        <p>To know whether you are actually improving your credit score, it is essential to

                            know what your credit score is in the first place and to check it regularly. This

                            will allow you to test the methods above and how effective they are in improving

                            your score. Quiddi Compare works with a number of credit checking companies
