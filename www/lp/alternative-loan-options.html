                            <p>If you are declined it is with good reason, applying again with the same details is not
                                likely to result in a successful application.</p>

                            <p>What we recommend you do is space your applications out by at least 5 minutes and try
                                applying for different types of credit. Apply for a smaller amount, use a guarantor or
                                logbook loan, there are many options which you can get accepted for.</p>

                                <p>If you have never had any credit before, lenders are hesitant to lend to you as they
                                    have no history of payments to determine how reliable you are. An appropriate loan
                                    is one tailored for newcomers or for poor credit ratings.</p>

                                <p>We suggest a <a href="http://www.bestukpaydayloan.co.uk/qc-decline-email/#credit-building-credit-cards">credit building credit card</a>, it is the fastest way to improve your
                                    credit rating and you can use the credit on the card to cover the costs which you
                                    need a loan for.</p>

                                <p>If you have a bad credit history, lenders will assume a similar scenario will occur
                                    again if they lend to you. Lenders will likely limit how much they will lend to you,
                                    to see if you can be responsible with smaller amounts. This means you will need to
                                    build your credit rating back up to be able to acquire larger sums of credit.</p>

                                <p>We suggest a <a href="#guarantorlaon">guarantor</a> or <a href="#logbookloan">logbook loan</a>, having
                                    someone to apply with you or a car as capital reduces the risk immensely.</p>

                                <p>When the lender looks up your credit history they will see every form of credit you
                                    have taken and your track record of payments. Active loans and recent missed
                                    payments is a big warning for lenders which makes you a riskier customer. </p>

                                <p>Lenders like consistency in your financial situation, it allows them to calculate
                                    your repayments based off your earnings. If you change jobs often they must consider

                                            <p><strong>Logbook loans are popular for those with bad credit who may have been turned down for loans by traditional banks or lenders. Not only can you get accepted with poor credit but you may be eligible for a larger sum of money compared to any other loan type.</strong></p>

                                            <p>Logbook loans refer to borrowing up to £50,000 secured on your vehicle. Whether it's your car, motorbike or van, you are asked to supply the lender with a 'log book' (V5 registration document) or MOT certificate for security. Borrowers will be asked to sign a form known as the 'Bill of Sale', which means that the lender will own your vehicle on a temporary basis. You are still able to use the car as normal so long as you meet all the monthly loan repayments. However, if you fail to repay the loan on the dates agreed, the bill of sale means that the lender can repossess your car without a court order.</p>
                                            <p>By providing your car as security, it gives the lender more confidence that they can recover the cost if the borrower is unable to meet repayment. Borrowers must be aware that failing to meet repayment will lead to the repossession of their car and additional charges in order to repurchase it. You can borrow up to £50,000 depending on the value of your motor vehicle and repay over 2 to 5 years in weekly or monthly installments. You can receive funds directly into your bank account in one lump sum on the same day or the same week depending on the lender. </p>

Combining all the debt into one place allows you to make affordable repayments, and makes repayment negotiations simple and easy as they is only one company to communicate with. </p>
                                            <p>The interest you pay will be decreased and you will be able to close down other credit card and loan accounts which will improve your credit rating. With each payment on your consolidated loan lenders will see you are being responsible and will be more likely to lend to you in the future. </p>
