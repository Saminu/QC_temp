                        <h2>What is a savings account?</h2>

                        <p>For those with disposable income, a savings account can be a sensible way to look after your
                            money. Banks are able to offer savings accounts that pay you a modest interest rate each
                            month, which is usually as a percentage of the value of your total savings. The financial
                            institution may set a minimum amount that you must deposit to open the account and this will
                            vary depending on the specific terms of the savings account.</p>

                        <p>Savings accounts are not typically for keeping money that you intend on using for day-to-day
                            activity but more as an investment opportunity. You cannot earn any interest if your money
                            is left sitting in a debit account or under a mattress at home. An active account allows you
                            to see a return on your savings and also keep your money protected by the bank.</p>

                        <h2>What are the main types of savings accounts</h2>

                        <p>There are many types of savings accounts, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
                            When you compare savings account, it is essential that you understand the difference of each
                            type so that you can chose an account that best serves your needs.</p>

                        <h2>Individual savings account - ISA</h2>

                        <p>Individual Savings Accounts, commonly known as ISAs, pay you a set interest rate on the value
                            of your savings. <a
                                    href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/feb/26/isas.moneyinvestments"
                                    target="_new">ISAs were introduced by the Government in 1999</a> and operate similar
                            to typical savings account but with a tax incentive.</p>

                        <p>The income you generate from a savings account is taxable by 20%, depending on your tax
                            bracket. By paying tax, it makes the return you get from the account not very worthwhile.
                            However, what is great about a Cash ISA is that it allows you to keep £15,000 of savings a
                            year for the 2014/2015 tax year without having to pay tax, specifically income and capital
                            gains tax on the interest earned. For those in high tax brackets of up to 40%, an ISA
                            certainly constitutes the best form of savings accounts.</p>

                        <p>As a result of simplifications in the law and regulation surrounding ISAs in April 2008 using
                            an ISA has become a much simpler. This is why for many people ISAs are an attractive option.
                            You can invest cash, stocks and shares or a combination of the two in an ISA. Any UK
                            resident over the age of 16 is eligible to open Cash ISA but in order to make use of the
                            stocks and shares component of an ISA you must be over 18.</p>

                        <h2>Regular savings accounts</h2>

                        <p>A regular savings account requires you to make minimum monthly deposits of £50 to £250 and
                            you can receive a high interest rate than other typical accounts. Usually lasting 12 months,
                            a regular savings account may offer the best return of up to 10% provided you are able to
                            afford the monthly deposits.</p>

                        <p>However, <a
                                href="http://citywire.co.uk/money/what-is-a-regular-savings-account-and-how-does-it-work/a608597"
                                target="_new">regular savings accounts</a> have a large amount of restrictions
                            associated to them. For instance, you are limited to the number of withdrawals you can make
                            with some accounts with some policies lasting for very long periods. In addition some banks
                            may only offer regular savings accounts to customers who have an existing account with them.
                            This means that in order to benefit from the high interest rates that regular savings
                            accounts offer you must also have a current account with the bank. As a result you need to
                            assess the accounts as a package and look at whether they are suitable option when combined.
                        </p>

                        <p>Before using a regular savings account, try see if you make use of the £15,000 tax-free
                            allowance on income earned as a result of interest payment from ISA accounts. If you have
                            used up this allowance in full and you have more money to save then it is worth considering
                            opening a regular savings account. </p>

                        <p>It is important that you look at the account holder because adding a partner’s name may make
                            you eligible for higher rates through a Joint Regular Savings Account. It is also possible
                            to open an account in your child’s name. </p>

                        <p>Beware of missed monthly repayments because simply one missed repayment may cause the bank to
                            drop your interest rate from 8% to 1%. Be sure to check the terms and conditions to see if
                            there is a payment holiday available. </p>

                        <h2>Fixed rate bonds savings accounts</h2>

                        <p>If you know that you are not going to need access to your savings then fixed rate bond
                            accounts can be a good option. With the base UK interest rate at a historic low of 0.5% more
                            and more people are looking for ways to increase the value of their interest payments. Fixed
                            rate bonds are an effective way to do this as you are paid a higher rate in return for
                            agreeing to lock your cash away for 6 months to 5 years.</p>

                        <p>Since the interest rate you are paid is fixed, a fixed rate bond can offer stability that
                            other accounts can’t since these are often tracked to the Bank of England base rate.</p>

                        <p>Agreeing to lock your savings in a fixed rate account for a longer period of time may mean
                            that you are able to benefit from higher interest rates, however you are also imposing
                            greater risk on your savings. This is because it is difficult to predict whether interest
                            rates on non-fixed accounts will change in the future and as a result of this it is
                            difficult to assess what will prove to be a more profitable place to store savings in the
                            future.</p>

                        <p>There are many different types of fixed rate accounts. It is a good idea to make use of a
                            fixed a rate ISA if you are determined to open a fixed rate account as you are able to
                            benefit from the £15,000 in tax allowances that they offer.</p>

                        <h2>Instant access savings accounts</h2>

                        <p>If you would like more flexibility from your savings account then an instant access savings
                            account may be the best savings account for you. Under an instant access savings account you
                            are able to withdraw money whenever you want. However, the downside is that instant access
                            savings accounts have typically lower interest rates than other accounts.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, instant access savings accounts tend to offer a higher interest rate for a
                            temporary period. Although time consuming, it is possible to move your savings from
                            different accounts in order to benefit from various bonuses that different banks may offer
                            as an incentive to encourage new customers to open accounts with them.</p>

                        <h2>Tips for getting high interest rate savings accounts </h2>

                        <p>The rate of interest paid by the savings account is the first thing people tend to look for
                            when choosing a savings account. The interest you earn is usually paid monthly or annually.
                            Usually you are liable to pay tax on any income you earn in the form of interest payments.
                            However certain savings accounts, notably ISAs allow you to save a certain amount of money
                            without having to pay tax. For the financial year of 2014/2015 you are allowed to save
                            £15,000 in an ISA every year without paying tax on the interest earned. </p>

                        <p>In addition, certain savings accounts, usually instant access savings account may offer
                            higher interest rates for an <strong>initial temporary period</strong> as an incentive to
                            attract new customers. It is important to look out for this when opening a savings account
                            so that you receive the level of interest payments you expect.</p>

                        <p>Also, in order to access certain savings account that require offer the best savings account
                            rates you may have to <strong>have another account with the bank</strong> as it may only be
                            able to new customers.  This may mean that you have to consider what another account such as
                            a current account and a high interest savings account can offer you as a package.</p>

                        <p>When choosing a savings account you should think about <strong>how long you are able to lock
                            your money in the account</strong>. Generally, you will be required to lock in your savings
                            for a longer period of time so that you can benefit from top savings account rates. </p>

                        <h2>Relying on interest rates as a form of income</h2>

                        <p>Some savings accounts pay you your interest annually. This may be a year after you open the
                            account or another predetermined date. Other savings accounts will pay your interest
                            monthly. If this will option is more suitable for your financial needs then you should
                            pursue it.</p>

                        <p>Some savings accounts may give you the choice on whether you are paid monthly or annually and
                            this is something you should look at when you compare the best savings accounts.</p>

                        <h2>Online savings accounts</h2>

                        <p>Many savings accounts operate exclusively online allowing you apply and monitor your funds
                            through their website. Several banks have an online mobile site or app, which allows you to
                            check your progress and receive regular updates.</p>
