                        <h1>Zopa Loans</h1>

                        <p>Zopa is the leading peer-to-peer lender in the UK. The London-based lender has

                            lent out almost £1 billion since 2005 and has won the Moneywise award for

                            ‘Most Trusted Loan Provider’ for 6 years running.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a peer-to-peer lender, Zopa have an online marketplace where they match

                            borrowers looking for good rates with investors looking to get a good return.

                            Zopa is therefore a viable alternative to personal loans or ISAs from a local bank.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Borrowing With Zopa</h2>

                        <p>Zopa allows customers to borrow between £1,000 up to £25,000 and repay in

                            monthly instalments over 1 to 5 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representative example: A loan of £7,500 over 5 years will cost you

                            £150.74 per month at 7.9% APR. The total cost after 5 years is £9,044, which

                            includes £1,404 interest at 7.1% fixed and a £140 fee. The total amount of credit

                            is £7,640.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Borrowers get a ‘quote’ within 48 hours rather than applying and getting an

                            instant decision. The reason for this quote is because Zopa need to assess your

                            credit rating and circumstances to find the right loan for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Borrowers will pay an interest rate depending on their credit score. Those with a

                            good credit rating are considered a low risk of default so are given a lower

                            interest rate to pay. By comparison, applicants with a poor credit rating are

                            given a higher interest rate on their loans to reflect the greater risk of default. So

                            depending on your credit, borrowers can pay between 4 to 16% APR on an

                            annual loan but it gets cheaper if you have the loan open for up to 5 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reasons for Zopa loans include paying for a new car, home improvements,

                            business, wedding or debt consolidation. To be eligible to borrow money with

                            Zopa, you must meet the following criteria:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>18 years old+</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>UK resident with 3 years of address history in the UK</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Employed with income of at least £12,000 a year</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Credit history which Zopa can see</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Good history of repaying debt</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Lending With Zopa</h2>
                        <p>
                            Zopa allows you to lend money to other people anonymously and receive a

                            return on what you lend out. The longer you save, the better rates you get. The

                            average return after 2 to 3 years is 3.8% and after 4 and 5 years, it increases to

                            5%. This is better than an average savings account of 1%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far around 60,000 people have lent their money to others through Zopa. You

                            can decide whether you want to lend to people with a good credit score or bad

                            credit score. Lending to those with bad credit will provide a greater return on

                            your investment because of the risks involved and lending to those with good

                            credit will provide a smaller return.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The average person lends around £2,000 with Zopa but you can start with as

                            little as £10. Every £10 that you borrow is lent out to a pool of people to diversify

                            the risk. No more than 2% of what you lend with Zopa will go to one borrower.

                            Every repayment you receive each month is then re-lent to compound and grow

                            your overall interest. Best of all, you can access your funds at any time and if you

                            want to withdraw, you can sell your loan to someone else.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The interest rate you receive may be subject to change if your borrower’s

                            default. However, Zopa’s Safeguard Trust uses technology and their customer

                            service team to follow up repayment with borrowers and they very rarely

                            default.
                        </p>
