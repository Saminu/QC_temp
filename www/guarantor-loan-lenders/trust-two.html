                        <h1>Trust Two Guarantor Loans</h1>

                        <p>Trust Two offer guarantor loans in the UK ranging from £1,000 to £7,500 that

                            are repaid over 18 to 60 months. As a guarantor lender, the loans offered are

                            unsecured and require another person to guarantee your loan such as a family

                            member or friend. By having a guarantor that has a good credit history, you are

                            more likely to be accepted for a loan with Trust Two and able to borrow more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Buckinghamshire-based company offers a competitive APR of 39.9% which

                            is lower than most guarantor lenders. All applications are completed and

                            processed online and once approved, funds can be transferred to your bank

                            account within 3 days. Their customer service team is available from Monday to

                            Friday 9am to 6pm and Saturdays from 9am to 12pm.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For A Trust Two Guarantor Loan?</h2>

                        <p>To apply for a guarantor loan, you must be over 18 years of age, a UK resident, in

                            employment and not declared bankrupt, in an IVA or debt management plan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every customer has to apply with a guarantor which can be a family member,

                            friend or colleague but not your husband, wife or partner. Guarantors must be

                            aged between 25 and 74 and should ideally have a good credit history. Trust Two

                            states that they accept guarantors who are both homeowners and tenants.

                            Guarantors are advised to be in a good financial position so that they can afford

                            to pay off the borrower’s loan if they fall into arrears.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Does The Application Work For Trust Two Guarantor Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            All applications are handled online and customers can click through this page to

                            apply directly on Trust Two’s website. Applicants will be asked to provide a few

                            details including their name and address, contact details, employment and bank

                            details. Information will need to be added about the guarantor including their

                            name, contact details and bank details. Trust Two will need the details of both

                            parties in order to run the relevant affordability and credit checks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lender needs a mobile phone number and email address so that they can

                            speak to each party and confirm their identity and the details they have

                            provided. If provisionally approved, an email will be sent to both parties

                            allowing them to ‘E-sign’ so that they can digitally sign the loan agreement

                            without having to fill in and send off any paperwork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the application is successful, the funds are transferred in the next 3 working

                            days and to prevent fraud, the money is sent in one lump sum to the guarantor’s

                            bank account who can forward the loan to the borrower or send it back to the

                            lender.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Do Repayments Work for Trust Two Guarantor Loans</h2>
                        <p>
                            The repayments are collected automatically in monthly instalments by Trust

                            Two directly from the borrower’s debit account. Collections are made on the

                            borrower’s pay date, usually the last working day of the month, because this is

                            when their account is likely to have cash available for collection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here is a representative payment example below:

                            £4,000 over 3 years. Representation 39.9% APR (Variable). Monthly Payment

                            £178.69. Annual interest rate 34% var. interest payable £2,432.75. Totally

                            repayable £6,432.75.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Default fees apply for customers that do not meet repayments on time. Once the

                            customer has been contacted on their repayment date and does not respond to

                            contact on a number of occasions, the guarantor’s bank account will be debited

                            for collection.
                        </p>
