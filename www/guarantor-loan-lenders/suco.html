                        <h1>SUCO Loans</h1>

                        <p>SUCO offer guarantor loans ranging between £1,000 to £12,000 and are repaid in

                            equal monthly instalments for 24 months up to 84 months. Based in Essex, SUCO

                            offer a competitive 39.9% APR. The application is completely online with no

                            upfront fees and there is same day funding for successful applicants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a guarantor lender, the loans offered are unsecured so you don’t have to risk

                            your assets as part of the application but you require a second person to act as a

                            guarantor and agree to pay the monthly instalments if you cannot.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Can I Use A SUCO Loan For?</h2>
                        <p>
                            SUCO’s website states that their guarantor loans can be used for home

                            improvements, emergencies, car loans, career development and peace of mind.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Guarantor loans are ideal for borrowers looking to gain access to funds but have

                            been denied by banks and commercial lenders due to poor credit. By having a

                            guarantor with a good credit rating, you are able to ‘piggy back’ off their credit

                            score and get the funds you need. This is why SUCO accept customers with bad

                            credit, CCJs, defaults and lack of credit history.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, since customers can borrow for up to 7 years and repay in small

                            monthly instalments, a SUCO loan offers flexibility and should be easier to

                            manage than the loans from other high street lenders.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Does The Application Work for SUCO Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            All applications with SUCO loans are processed online. As a direct lender, you can

                            apply directly on the SUCO website by clicking through this page and you will be

                            in contact with them throughout your entire application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Applicants will start by providing details including their name, address, contact

                            details, income and employment and also give information about their

                            guarantor.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            SUCO will carry out a series of credit checks and affordability on both the

                            applicant and the guarantor. Using credit reference agencies such as Equifax,

                            SUCO can gain access to credit files that provide information on credit history,

                            debt and loans outstanding. The affordability measures confirm the levels of

                            income and employment through pay-slips and bank statements. Using this

                            information, SUCO can assess whether you are eligible for a loan, how much you

                            are able to afford and repay.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By having a guarantor with a good credit history, it will increase your chances of

                            being approved. A guarantor is usually a family member, friend or colleague.

                            SUCO insist that guarantors are aged between 18-75, have a regular income and

                            are UK homeowners because it will demonstrate a high credit rating and mean

                            that the guarantors are less likely to leave the country if they have a property.

                            Most SUCO Loans are transferred to the guarantor’s bank account within 1 to 2

                            days. The guarantor can decide to send the money to the borrower or change

                            their mind and send it back to SUCO. To speed up the process, borrowers and

                            guarantors can make themselves more available to confirm their information

                            over the phone and provide relevant documents.
                        </p>



                        <h2>How Does Repayment Work For Suco Loans?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Repayments with SUCO are made in equal monthly instalments. SUCO offer

                            between £1,000 and £2,000 for up to 2 years but if you want to borrow up to

                            £12,000, you have the choice to repay over 7 years if you wish. Customers have

                            the option to repay early at any point and it is typically cheaper to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representative Example: Borrow £7,500 over 60 months. Monthly repayment

                            £279.25. Totally repayable £16,755.00
