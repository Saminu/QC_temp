                        <p>Amigo Loans is the most established and largest guarantor loan lender in the UK.

                            You may have seen their adverts on TV or heard their catchy jingle on the radio.

                            The Bournemouth-based loan provider has approved over 160,000 loans since

                            they were founded in 2005.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a guarantor loan lender, a customer can borrow between £500 and £5,000 for

                            1 year to 5 years and they must have a guarantor in place that agrees to repay

                            their loan if the main borrower cannot meet repayments. The representative

                            APR is 49.9% and customers can apply on their website through their ‘5 minute

                            application’ which you can access directly by clicking through this page. If

                            successful, funds can be transferred within 24 hours but usually takes around 48

                            hours.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Amigo recommend having a guarantor with very good credit history or one

                            which is preferably a homeowner because if you cannot repay your loan, there is

                            a good chance that someone with good credit will be able to. This is why Amigo

                            Loans are popular for those individuals with bad credit especially if they have

                            been unable to access funds from other commercial lenders. Amigo mentions

                            that customers with bad credit are able to rebuild their credit rating if they pay

                            on time because the information is passed onto a credit reference agency.
                        </p>


                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For An Amigo Loan?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Borrowers with a bad credit history can still be eligible for a loan with Amigo,

                            even if they have a CCJ. However, the guarantor must be aged between 18 and 75

                            and a very good credit history, preferably a UK homeowner. The idea is that

                            homeowners usually have a strong credit rating in order to get a mortgage and

                            they are less likely to leave town if they have a property.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The idea of having a strong guarantor is based largely on trust. Amigo believe

                            that if someone with good credit history trusts you, then Amigo can trust you

                            too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How much you can borrow with Amigo Loans depends on a number of factors.

                            The longer you have the loan open for with Amigo, the more you can borrow. For

                            instance, if you want to borrow £500, the maximum time period is 12 months

                            but if you want to borrow £5,000, you can repay over 60 months.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, the more income you receive each month, the more you are

                            therefore able to borrow and repay. Amigo will carry out affordability checks

                            prior to approving your loan – this may involve confirming your salary with a

                            copy of your pay-slip or bank statement in order to match up what you wish to

                            borrow and can afford to repay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A key factor determining how much you can borrow will depend on the credit

                            rating of your guarantor. The stronger your guarantor, the more you will be able

                            to borrow as Amigo feel there is less risk in recovering their loan. Also, being a

                            repeat customer after repaying successful loans in the past will likely increase

                            the amount you are able to borrow.

                            Here is a representative payment example: Representative APR 49.9%. Borrow

                        <h2>How Does The Application Work For Trust Two Guarantor Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            All applications are handled online and customers can click through this page to

                            apply directly on Trust Two’s website. Applicants will be asked to provide a few

                            details including their name and address, contact details, employment and bank

                            details. Information will need to be added about the guarantor including their

                            name, contact details and bank details. Trust Two will need the details of both

                            parties in order to run the relevant affordability and credit checks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lender needs a mobile phone number and email address so that they can

                            speak to each party and confirm their identity and the details they have

                            provided. If provisionally approved, an email will be sent to both parties

                            allowing them to ‘E-sign’ so that they can digitally sign the loan agreement

                            without having to fill in and send off any paperwork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the application is successful, the funds are transferred in the next 3 working

                            days and to prevent fraud, the money is sent in one lump sum to the guarantor’s

                            bank account who can forward the loan to the borrower or send it back to the

                            lender.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Do Repayments Work for Trust Two Guarantor Loans</h2>
                        <p>
                            The repayments are collected automatically in monthly instalments by Trust

                            Two directly from the borrower’s debit account. Collections are made on the

                            borrower’s pay date, usually the last working day of the month, because this is

                            when their account is likely to have cash available for collection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here is a representative payment example below:

                            £4,000 over 3 years. Representation 39.9% APR (Variable). Monthly Payment

                            £178.69. Annual interest rate 34% var. interest payable £2,432.75. Totally

                            repayable £6,432.75.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Default fees apply for customers that do not meet repayments on time. Once the

                            customer has been contacted on their repayment date and does not respond to

                            contact on a number of occasions, the guarantor’s bank account will be debited

                            for collection.
                        </p>
