                        <h1>Quick Cash Club Guarantor Loans</h1>

                        <p>
                            Quick Cash Club offers guarantor loans ranging from £100 to £750 repaid over 6

                            to 24 months in equal monthly instalments. Set up in 2012, the West Yorkshire-

                            based firm, offer a completely online application via desktop, mobile or tablet

                            and offer same day funds to those approved on a working day before 4pm. As a

                            direct lender, there are no upfront admin or broker fees charged to applicants.

                            As a guarantor loan lender, customers must have a guarantor involved as part of

                            their loan application. This is usually a family member or friend who you know

                            well and can discuss your finances with. The role of the guarantor is to agree to

                            cover the cost of the loan if the main borrower cannot afford to repay. Guarantor

                            loans are popular for those with a bad credit history because having a guarantor

                            with a good credit record increases your chances of being approved.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Does The Application Work For Quick Cash Club?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The application is completely online and the borrower will fill in their basic

                            details about themselves and their guarantor and choose how much they want to

                            borrow and for how long. After a few checks, if the borrower is provisionally

                            accepted, they will be sent a unique PIN code by SMS. They will give this code to

                            the person that they want to be their guarantor who will enter this PIN online to

                            complete the application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Quick Cash Club will carry out further checks on both the borrower and the

                            guarantor including credit checks and affordability. By understanding both

                            credit histories, they can get an idea of how well both parties have paid other

                            loans in the past and if they have any debt outstanding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The affordability measures look at both levels of income to get an idea of how

                            much they can afford to borrow and repay. Quick Cash Club will usually perform

                            a phone call to the borrower and the guarantor to confirm some details about

                            their loan and make it clear that the guarantor must cover repayment if the

                            borrower defaults.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the application is approved, the funds can be sent to the guarantor’s bank

                            account on the same day. This is a security measure to ensure that there is

                            actually a guarantor as part of the transaction who can decide to send the money

                            to the borrower or change their mind and send it back to the lender.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Am I Eligible For A Loan With Quick Cash Club?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Quick Cash Club states that there is an eligibility requirement for the borrower

                            and the guarantor. For the borrower, they must be 18 years or over, UK resident,

                            not bankrupt or IVA and have a valid debit card in order to receive their loan and

                            collect repayments. Borrowers will also be required to have a working mobile

                            phone so that they can be contacted by Quick Cash Club at any time but also

                            receive their PIN code by SMS.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To be a guarantor, this is usually a family member or friend of the borrower. The

                            guarantor is not typically a husband, wife or life partner. Quick Cash Club

                            requires guarantors to be over 21 years old, have a good credit history, minimum

                            income of £800 and employed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlike other guarantor lenders, Quick Cash Club accepts guarantors that are not

                            homeowners but having good credit and owning a car or home will increase the

                            chances of the loan being accepted. This is because good credit guarantors are

                            more likely to be able to repay a loan and also less likely to leave the country if

                            they have a car and home.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Do Repayments Work For Quick Cash Club?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The repayments for a Quick Cash Club loan are made by the main borrower of

                            the guarantor loan and if they default on repayment, the guarantor is required to

                            step in and pay the monthly repayment or outstanding debt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is a representative payment example: Borrow £500 over 12 months. Repay

                            £82.60 a month. Total repayable £991.20. Interest Rate 150% (variable).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The repayments are collected in equal monthly instalments for up to 24 months

                            from the borrower’s debit account. Using a process known as continuous

                            payment authority, the borrower’s debit card is tokenized during the application

                            and it allows Quick Cash Club to collect the amount owed to them each month

                            from the customer’s bank account on the scheduled pay date. This ensures a

                            smooth repayment process and usually an email and SMS is sent on the days

                            leading up to each monthly repayment so there are no surprises for the

                            borrower.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Failing to repay the loan on time will require Quick Cash Club to pass on the

                            information to a credit reference agency such as Experian or Equifax. Therefore,

                            missed repayments may negatively impact the credit score of both the borrower

                            and the guarantor. However, if the borrower pays their loan on time, the

                            information is still passed on and may improve the customer’s credit score.
                        </p>
