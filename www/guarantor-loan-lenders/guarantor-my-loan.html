                        <h1>Guarantor My Loan</h1>

                        <p>Guarantor My Loan is a Norwich-based guarantor lender offering loans from

                            £1,000 to £5,000 which are repaid in monthly instalments over 1 to 5 years. With

                            a competitive 48.9% APR, the application is completely online and takes only 5

                            minutes to complete. There are no upfront fees for applying and as a direct

                            lender, the funds can be transferred to your account on the same day of being

                            approved.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Is Guarantor My Loan Different To Other Guarantor Lenders?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Guarantor My Loan operates as a normal guarantor lender in the sense that all

                            applicants require a second person to act as a guarantor. This person is usually a

                            family member or friend who agrees to repay the loan if the main borrower

                            defaults.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is different about Guarantor My Loan is that they offer cashback if you

                            repay your loan on time. Customers will receive a month’s repayment back into

                            their debit account in the form of cashback as a thank you for paying their loan

                            successfully – and this can equal to a few hundred pounds.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, Guarantor My Loan is able to offer guarantor loans to customers

                            with bad credit. This lender is willing to approve loans for those with poor credit

                            and CCJs, whilst some guarantor lenders do not. However, borrowers are

                            required to have a guarantor with a certain criteria.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For Guarantor My Loan?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Borrowers who wish to apply with Guarantor My Loan must be over 18, in

                            employment and a UK resident.  The borrower has a responsibility to find

                            someone to be their guarantor. Guarantors must be aged 21 to 72 with a good

                            credit history, income and must be a homeowner.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If the guarantor has a good credit record, the lender feels comfortable that the

                            loan will be repaid. This is why Guarantor My Loan requires guarantors to be

                            homeowners because it suggests a certain high level of credit and also means

                            they are less likely to leave town if they have a property.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Does The Application Work For Guarantor My Loan?</h2>

                        <p>
                            The application is completely online and the main borrower will be required to

                            provide information about themselves including their address, employment and

                            income. Applicants will also need to add information about their guarantor.

                            Guarantor My Loan will run a series of credit checks and affordability checks to

                            determine the financial situation of both the borrower and the guarantor and to

                            see whether they are eligible for a loan.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            How much you can borrow depends on your personal financial situation and the

                            credit rating of your guarantor. Lenders like Guarantor My Loan have to be

                            careful not to lend too much or the customer will fall into arrears. Therefore,

                            those in employment and generating a higher income will be able to borrow

                            more but having a guarantor with a good credit history will significantly boost

                            your chances of getting approved.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once approved, the funds are transferred to the guarantor’s bank account. This

                            acts a fraud prevention measure as it confirms that there is definitely a

                            guarantor involved. Above all, it allows the guarantor to have control of the

                            finances so they can decide to send the money in part or in full to the borrower

                            or they can change their mind and give it back to the lender without any fees

                            being charged.
                        </p>



                        <h2>How Do The Repayments Work For Guarantor My Loan?</h2>

                        <p>Guarantor My Loan collects the repayments in equal monthly instalments. You

                            can decide how you wish to repay – most customers repay using direct debit but

                            you can also repay by phone, online or at any PayPoint location.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Customers have the option to repay early if they wish. There are no early

                            repayment fees and it may be cheaper to clear your account early and save on

                            the interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representative Example: Borrow £3,000 over 3 years. Representative 48.9%

                            APR. Monthly repayment: £145.17. Annual interest rate 40.48% variable.

                            Interest payable £2,226.12. Totally repayable £5,2226.12
