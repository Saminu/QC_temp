                            between £500 to £5,000 and repay over 12 to 60 months in equal monthly

                            instalments. 1 Plus 1 is a direct lender, the entire application is completed online

                            and there are no upfront fees for applying. Successful applications can be funded

                            via bank transfer on the same day and if you have any questions, 1 Plus 1’s office

                            hours are 9am to 6pm Monday to Friday but they will respond to emails 24/7.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may have seen 1 Plus 1’s advert on TV, they explain that you require a

                            guarantor as part of the application. This is a person you know such as a family

                            or friend who has a better credit rating than you and is willing to cover the cost

                            of your loan is you cannot meet the monthly repayments. The idea is that you can

                            ask a person to be your ‘+1’ to help you get the funds you need for a home

                            improvement, car or emergency purpose.

                        <h2>How 1 Plus 1 Loan’s Help Those With Bad Credit</h2>

                        <p>
                            Guarantor loans like those from 1 Plus 1 are popular for those individuals with a

                            bad credit rating or no credit rating to get access to the funds they need. By

                            having a guarantor with a good credit history, you increase the chances of your

                            loan being accepted. Lenders like 1 Plus 1 consider that if your guarantor has a

                            good credit history, they should be able to cover the cost of your loan if you

                            cannot, so this reduces the overall risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1 Plus 1 work with credit reference agency Equifax and share your credit data

                            with them. So if you are the borrower who previously had bad credit, if you

                            repay your loan off with 1 Plus 1 on time, the positive information will be sent

                            back to Equifax and this will cause your credit score to improve.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Does The Application For 1 Plus 1 Loans Work?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The application for 1 Plus 1 Loans is 100% online. Borrowers will be asked to

                            provide information about themselves and their guarantor through the online

                            application, which you can access by clicking through this page. Both parties will

                            be required to speak to 1 Plus 1 over the phone to confirm a few details and

                            ensure they understand how the guarantor loan works and the repayment

                            responsibility. Both parties will be required to electronically sign the online

                            agreement through a verification SMS code and email link. If successful, the

                            funds can be transferred on the same day.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For A 1 Plus 1 Loan?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although borrowers with bad credit are eligible for a loan with 1 Plus 1,

                            borrowers cannot have an IVA or be bankrupt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Choosing the right guarantor is crucial to the application. Your parents or

                            siblings are allowed to be your guarantor, provided that they have a good credit

                            rating. However, a partner, husband or wife that live in the same property or

                            own the same home as you cannot be your guarantor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be eligible to be a guarantor, you must have the following criteria:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Be a homeowner</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Have a good credit rating</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Aged 18 to 75</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Guarantors must give their consent to be part of the loan and have disposable

                            income to pay the loan if the main borrower defaults. A borrower will be able to

                            choose three guarantors but as part of the three-strike rule, if all guarantors fail

                            to meet the criteria, the application will be cancelled.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Does Repayment Work For 1 Plus 1 Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Repayments are made in equal monthly instalments will are collected by 1 Plus 1

                            automatically from the borrower’s debit account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representative Example: Borrowing £500 over 12

                            per month, total repayable £615.00. Representative 48.3% APR
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Customers have the option to repay early at any time by calling up or repaying

                            through the account section of the website. It will usually be cheaper to repay

                            your loan early.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If the borrower misses a repayment and cannot be contacted within 24 hours,

                            the guarantor will be notified by email, SMS and phone call. If the guarantor does

                            not respond within 24 hours, the outstanding payment may be debited from the

                            guarantor’s account. Received payments will be notified by email and SMS.
                        </p>
