                        <p>Essex-based TFS Loans have been offering guarantor loans in the UK since 2009.

                            As a guarantor lender, borrowers require a guarantor to be involved in the

                            process who agree to cover the cost of the loan if they are unable to repay. This

                            guarantor is usually a family member, friend or colleague.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TFL Loans lets customers borrow between £1,000 and £12,00 and repay in

                            monthly instalments over the course of 1 year up to 7 years. With a competitive

                            APR of 48.9%, there are no upfront costs for applying and the application is

                            completely entirely online. Simply click through this page to be taken directly to

                            their application form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both the borrower and the guarantor will be required to fill in details online

                            including their contact details, income and bank details. If both parties pass the

                            relevant credit and affordability checks, they will be required to E-sign the loan

                            agreement online or by post to complete the transaction. If successful, the funds

                            can be transferred on the same day.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Much Can I Borrow From TFS Loans?</h2>

                        <p>Customers can borrow up to £12,000 for up to 7 years however this maximum

                            borrowing facility is dependent on a number of factors. By having a higher

                            income or a guarantor with a very good credit history, you are more likely to be

                            approved and borrow more - as lenders like TFS Loans consider this a lower risk

                            of customer default. There may be a limit of how much you can borrow on your

                            first loan but repeat customers that demonstrate a good repayment history may

                            be able to borrow more on their subsequent loans.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For TFS Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            For a borrower to be eligible for TFS Loans, they must be over 18, a UK resident

                            and in employment with a regular income so that they can afford to repay their

                            loan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The borrower must have a guarantor willing to repay their loan if they default.

                            TFS Loans only accept guarantor that are homeowners because this

                            demonstrates a better credit rating. Guarantors must also be aged between 18

                            and 78, have a regular income and a good credit history.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Do Repayments Work with TFL Loans</h2>

                        <p>
                            Repayments are collected straight from the borrower’s debit account in equal

                            monthly instalments starting from 1 year up to 7 years. Using continuous

                            payment authority, TFS Loans will be able to automatically collect from the

                            borrower’s account on their pay date each month, enabling a smooth repayment

                            process. Borrowers have the option to repay early at any point and it will

                            typically be cheaper to do so.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Representative repayment example: Borrow £4,500 over 60 months. Repay

                            £175.91 per month. Total repayable £10,554.60
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The guarantor’s account will not be debited each month, this is only in the case

                            that the customer defaults their repayment and does not respond to contact from

                            the lender. If a borrower fail to make a repayment, the guarantor will be notified

                            within 10 days if they need to make a repayment. The guarantor will only be

                            required to cover the monthly repayment until the borrower can start paying

                            again.
                        </p>
