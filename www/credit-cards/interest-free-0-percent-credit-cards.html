                        <h2>What is an Interest Free and 0% Credit Card?</h2>

                        <p>Interest free and 0% credit cards allow users to borrow for free for a set period of time.
                            They are ideal for new customers who can afford to pay off debt within the allocated time
                            period. Interest free cards are used by lenders to attract new credit card customers. There
                            is two main types of interest free credit cards: 0% purchases cards and 0% balance transfers
                            cards. Individuals can also get a single card which offers both of these functions although
                            getting two separate cards is more common.</p>

                        <p>When looking for zero percent credit cards it is important to look out for key features that
                            differentiate interest free credit cards. The most important thing to consider is the length
                            of the interest free introductory period. By using a company that allows cardholders to
                            borrow interest free for a longer period of time means that you have longer to pay off the
                            debt without having to pay hefty interest rates. It is essential that minimum payments are
                            made on time otherwise the interest free period may be terminated.</p>

                        <h2>Types of Credit Cards for interest free and 0% interest credit </h2>

                        <h3>Interest free and 0% interest purchase credit cards</h3>

                        <p>An interest free purchase credit cards enables cardholders to spread large debts into smaller
                            and more affordable payments. As long as you pay the debt on time and meet the minimum
                            payments you will not have to pay any interest on the amount borrowed on an interest free
                            credit card. Taking your credit history into consideration, the card issuer will set a
                            spending limit once you apply for the card.</p>

                        <h3>Interest free and 0% interest balance transfer credit cards</h3>

                        <p>An interest free balance transfer credit card allows users to transfer existing debt to
                            another card where 0% interest is charged. As with interest free purchase cards the interest
                            free period is only temporary and if debts are not cleared within the specified time frame
                            then interest will be charged on existing debt.</p>

                        <p>To transfer the balance, card providers will typically charge a fee of around 3% of the total
                            debt to do this. The availability and the exact terms of this service depend on your
                            previous credit history. </p>

                        <h2>The advantages of credit cards for Interest Free and 0% credit</h2>

                        <p>The biggest advantage of using an interest free credit card is simply the fact that it allows
                            cardholders to borrow money without paying any interest for a defined period of time as long
                            as the necessary terms are met. This allows cardholders to make purchases that they
                            otherwise would not have the cash flow to make.</p>

                        <p>In addition, zero percent interest transfer balances allow users to transfer existing debt to
                            new cards where interest will not need to be paid. This has the potential to make debt
                            cheaper, even with a transfer fee included (typically between 3% and 5% of the total
                            debt).</p>

                        <p>You can expect to receive the same benefits of a typical credit from an interest free credit
                            card. For example, 0% interest credit cards provide extra protection offered to consumers by
                            section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This law states that customers who make purchases on
                            their credit cards of up to £30,000 will be refunded by the credit card company if the good
                            is lost, stolen, faulty or goes missing. You simply need to make a claim to the credit card
                            company in order to get a refund and this type of protection is not available when using a
                            debit card.</p>

                        <h2>The disadvantages of credit cards for Interest Free and 0% interest credit</h2>

                        <p>The biggest downside of interest free credit is that it can become very costly if you do not
                            complete all payments within the allocated time frame. If users do not make all payments by
                            the end of the period then they should expect to pay typical interest rates on remaining
                            debt, which tend to be relatively high. This means that 0% interest credit may not be
                            suitable for those who are not sure whether they will be able to pay off the debt in the
                            time frame.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, interest free credit cards might not be the best option for those who expect to
                            pay off their debt in full. It may be better for these groups to use a card that rewards
                            spending such as cashback credit cards.</p>

                        <p>It is also important to note that when using an interest free credit card you must make
                            minimum payments. If minimum payments are not made then the 0% interest introductory period
                            may end and interest will have to be paid on remaining debt. In order to avoid this it is
                            recommended to set up a direct debit for these payments.</p>

                        <p>Repeatedly transferring balances between different interest free credit cards may seem like a
                            good idea but this practice is very risky. This practice of transferring balances is also
                            known as “tarting” and can damage you credit score because it looks like you are trying to
                            prolong the payment of your debt. So “tarting” may make it more difficult for you to obtain
                            credit in the future. Also moving balances to different cards too often will cause the
                            transferring costs to accumulate.</p>

                        <p>Finally, 0% interest credit cards may offer you a lower spending limit then you hoped for. A
                            credit card with a low interest rate might offer a higher spending limit and therefore might
                            be a more suitable option depending on your needs.</p>
