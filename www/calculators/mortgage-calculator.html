                    <h2>Compare fixed rate mortgages from Quiddi Compare</h2>

                    <p>We offer the best fixed rate mortgage deals from some of the leading mortgage providers in the
                        UK. By simply filling in your details above, one of advisors will call you to assist with your

                        partners to work with so you can confident that you will be getting the best deals possible.
                        Usually, to access the lowest fixed mortgage rates, it helps to have a good credit rating and a
                        large deposit available. If you already have a property in mind, be sure to budget how much you
                        think you can afford and what kind of loan-to-value (LTV) you require.</p>

                    <h2>Fixed rate mortgage – how does it work?</h2>

                    <p>A fixed rate mortgage is the interest rate you pay to the mortgage provider and remains the same
                        throughout the mortgage term typically lasting 2,3,5 or 10 years. The interest rate you pay is
                        not affected by the lender’s standard variable rate or the Bank of England’s base rate. At the
                        end of the fixed term, your mortgage will usually be transferred to the lenders standard
                        variable rate (SVC) but this is usually higher than average so at this point you would likely
                        find a new mortgage deal.</p>

                    <p>The key advantage of a fixed rate mortgage is that it you can be sure that there will be no
                        changes in the interest rate you are paying. So for homeowners that are looking to budget, they
                        will know exactly how much they will be paying month after month and year after year. If there
                        are ever changed in the Bank of England’s base rate, you will not be affected because you will
                        always be paying the same interest rate to your mortgage provider. There is also the opportunity
                        to benefit from a lower interest rate in the first few years giving new buyers some disposable
                        income to spend on furniture and home improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Types of fixed rate mortgages</h2>

                    <p>Fixed rate mortgage typically last for 2 to 3 years but lenders are most recently offering 5 to
                        10 year products. The longer the mortgage term, the higher the interest rate you usually pay.
                        This is because there is a premium for the added security for paying a fixed rate over a long
                        period of time, free of any market fluctuations to the variable rate or Bank of England base
                        rate.</p>

                    <h2>2 year fixed rate mortgage</h2>

                    <p>A 2 year fix is a very low-risk option because you will benefit if the other variable or base
                        rate increases but if it does not, you can always change your mortgage after the two-year
                        spell.</p>

                    <h2>3 year fixed rate mortgage</h2>

                    <p>By taking a 3 year fixed rate mortgage, the typical interest rate is likely to be slightly higher
                        than a 2 year fix because you are paying for the extra security. However, this product might
                        suit various homeowners who plan to move house again in the next years. This way, they can
                        budget exactly what they are going to spend and can plan ahead.</p>

                    <h2>5 year fixed rate mortgage</h2>

                    <p>Since a 5 year fixed rate mortgage is a long period, the homeowner may in fact lose out on better
                        rates in the market. If their mortgage company’s variable rate is lower, the homeowner will not
                        be able to change mortgages very easily. The fixed rate mortgages have an early repayment
                        penalty in order to tie you in for longer and this can cost up to 6 months of mortgage
                        payments.</p>

                    <h2>10 year fixed rate mortgage</h2>

                    <p>The 10-year fix is usually the most expensive because again, you are paying to avoid the chance
                        of any rate fluctuations. Similar to the 5-year product, there are early payment penalties that
                        apply should you wish to change the type of mortgage product. As a result, homeowners on a 10
                        year fixed mortgage rate may miss out on better rates available. Mortgage applicants are advised
                        to consider the possibility of better rates being available before proceeding.</p>

                    <h3>Useful advice</h3>

                    <p>For anyone applying for a fixed rate mortgage, it is important to think about how long you want
                        the loan for. If you think that you are in a financial position where you will be able to
                        overpay on your mortgage, you can do so for up to 10% per year. However, there will be an early
                        payment penalty should you wish to clear your debt early, up to 6 months worth of payments and
                        this is not ideal. So it is essential to weigh up just how long you want the fixed mortgage for
                        or whether you think that you would be better off with a tracker mortgage or variable
                        mortgage.</p>

                    <p>If you are still undecided, one of the most common things to do with a fixed rate mortgage is to
                        use the fixed rate for 2 years and then to assess the variable rates and Bank of England base
                        rate. Here, you can decide whether you should switch to a different mortgage product or indeed
                        take out a new 2 year mortgage.</p>

                    <p>When comparing the cost of mortgage products, it is important to remember that additional fees
                        apply. Mortgage providers will always charge an arrangement fee for organizing the loan and this
                        can cost a few hundred or thousand pounds. However, depending on the mortgage company, there may
                        be deals available that reduce the arrangement fee e.g discounts for first time buyers. Also, be
                        sure to see if the mortgage company offers rewards such as a cashback.</p>

                    <p>Finally, it is recommended to carefully budget how much you can afford to repay on your mortgage
                        each month. Failing to repay your monthly repayment on time may incur further charges and
                        long-term arrears may lead to the repossession of your property. There is also the negative
                        impact on your credit rating because your credit file is shared between the mortgage lender and
                        other credit reference agencies. Failing to repay your mortgage payments on time may cause your
                        credit score to fall and make it harder to access credit in the future.</p>
