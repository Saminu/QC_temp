                        <h1>Loans 2 Go Logbook Loans</h1>

                        <p>Loans 2 Go is one of the biggest logbook loan lenders in the UK, allowing you to

                            borrow up to £50,000 secured on your car. With their head offices in Lancashire,

                            the company has over 78 branches across the country so customers are required

                            to apply in person at one of their high street stores. This means that you cannot

                            apply online but you can get a car valuation through their website and see how

                            much you can borrow and also request a callback to get your application started.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By releasing the equity from your car, you are able to access loans and borrow

                            higher amounts that you perhaps would be able to from a bank or other

                            commercial lender. Since you are putting your car down as collateral, the lenders

                            believe that there is less risk of recovering costs if you are unable to repay. As a

                            result, logbook loans with Loans 2 Go are available to those customers with a bad

                            or poor credit history.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Do You Apply For Loans 2 Go Logbook Loans?</h2>

                        <p>To apply for a logbook loan with Loans 2 Go, you can request a call back on their

                            website or visit one of their stores in person to apply. Loan 2 Go branches are

                            open from 9:30am to 5:30pm Monday to Friday and 10:00am to 3:00pm on

                            Saturdays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As part of the application process, there are a number of things you need to

                            provide including:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Your vehicle logbook (V5 document)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Photo ID e.g driving license, passport</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Proof of address</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Proof of income for last 3 months</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Proof of MOT and paid tax for your vehicle</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Proof that the car is free of finance</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It must be noted that by providing your V5 document and signing a ‘bill of sale’

                            you are giving temporary ownership to Loans 2 Go. This means that you can

                            continue to drive your car as normal but the lender still has ownership of your

                            vehicle until you have repaid your logbook loan in full.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the positives about Loans 2 Go is that they will accept cars of all ages

                            whereas some lenders say that there is a limit of how old you car is to be eligible

                            for a logbook loan e.g 7 or 8 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you can provide all this information to Loans 2 Go and you have passed the

                            various checks, your logbook loan can be approved on the same day and funds

                            up to £50,000 can be sent directly to your bank account. If you are looking to

                            receive cash in hand, this is also available on the same day for sums ranging from

                            £500 to £2,500.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Much Can You Borrow from Loan 2 Go Logbook Loans? </h2>
                        <p>
                            Customers can borrow up to £50,000 but whether you can borrow as much as

                            this will depend on a number of factors. The value of your car is important

                            because the loan is secured on your vehicle. Therefore, the more new and

                            valuable your car, the more you are able to borrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, Loan 2 Go will run a series of credit and affordability checks to

                            decide how much you can borrow. The credit checks act as a way of finding out

                            how well you have repaid other loans in the past and how much debt you have

                            outstanding. So if you have a good credit record, you will be entitled to a higher

                            borrowing facility. In terms of affordability, the lender needs to see how much

                            you earn each month with the proof of a pay-slip or bank statement. With this

                            information, they can estimate how much you can afford to repay without going

                            into arrears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Borrowers with Loans 2 Go have the option to top up their loans or have more

                            than one loan open on the same car provided that they fulfill the credit and

                            affordability criteria.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Do The Repayments Work For Loan 2 Go Logbook Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Repayments for Loans 2 Go are collected in weekly or monthly instalments over

                            12, 18, 24, 30 or 36 months. With small payments coming out of your account

                            each month, it should be a lot easier to manage rather than one large sum at the

                            end of each month.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Loan 2 Go states that the cost of their loan is cheaper than a bank overdraft and

                            here is a representative payment example:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Representative APR: 387.4%, Fixed Annual Rate: 120%, Total Amount of Credit:

                            £850, Term: 18 monthly repayments of £132.22, Total amount payable:

                            £2,379.96.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Customers have the option to repay early at any time and there is no extra cost

                            for doing so. In fact, repaying early may save you money and if you wish to

                            borrow money for just one month, you will pay £85 maximum.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Failure to keep up with repayment can lead to default fees and the repossession

                            of your vehicle. Your vehicle will be sold at market value and you will be

                            required to pay the shortfall of your outstanding debt. You will also have the

                            opportunity to repurchase your vehicle.
