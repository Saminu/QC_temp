                        <h1>Gissaloan Logbook Loans</h1>

                        <p>London-based Gissaloan offer logbook loans in the UK which allow you to

                            borrow money for up to 24 months. Customers are required to secure the loan

                            with their car so if you are unable to meet repayments, your car may be

                            repossessed by the lender to cover the cost of the loan. But by putting your car

                            down as collateral, customers with bad credit are able to gain access to finance

                            that would otherwise be inaccessible with mainstream lenders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Customers can apply via mobile, desktop or in person with Gissaloan provided

                            they make an appointment. Applicants will be required to send in paperwork

                            regarding their vehicle and their income prior to approval but provided this can

                            be sent quickly, Gissaloan offer same day approval and funding for their logbook

                            loans.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Much Can You Borrow With Gissaloan Logbook Loans?</h2>

                        <p>Customers applying for logbook loans with Gissaloan can borrow between £500

                            and £25,000. How much a customer can borrow will depend on the value of their

                            vehicle which they are putting down as collateral. Typically, the newer the car,

                            the more it is worth and this will increase your borrowing facility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other factors that contribute towards how much you can borrow include your

                            level of affordability and credit rating. Those customers with higher levels of

                            income and a good credit history will be eligible to borrow more than others.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Is The Criteria For a Gissaloan Logbook Loan?</h2>
                        <p>
                            To be eligible for a Gissaloan logbook loan, customers must be willing to put

                            down their car as collateral. The car must be less than 12 years old and free from

                            finance or nearly free. Customers must be in employment and self-employed

                            applicants are eligible too.
                        </p>
                        <p>Applicants will be required to provide the following:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>V5 logbook in their name for a minimum of 3 months</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Up to date MOT</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Tax certificate</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Full UK driving license</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>3 years address history</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Pay-slip or bank statement</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>2 up to date proofs of address</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            A ‘bill of sale’ must be signed by the customer and this legally transfers the

                            ownership of the vehicle to Gissaloan who will hold on it until the loan has been

                            repaid. Customers are still able to drive the car as usual during the loan term.
                        </p>


                        <h2>How Does Repayment Work For Gissaloan Logbook Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Repayments are collected automatically every week or month, depending on

                            your loan repayment terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is a repayment example: Loan Amount: £1000.00. Loan Term, 78 weeks.

                            Instalments: £30.13 Per Week. Total Repayable: £2350.14. Fixed Annual Interest

                            Rate: 90.00%. Representative APR 281.59%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Collections are taken by Gissaloan through your direct debit card. Customers

                            have the option to repay early and clear their account at any time and they may

                            be eligible for a rebate when doing so.
                        </p>
