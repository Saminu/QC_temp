                        <p>A logbook lender allows you to borrow up to £50,000 and repay over

                            2 to 5 years in weekly or monthly instalments. <a href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/logbook-loans">Logbook loans</a> are

                            secured on the borrower’s vehicle allowing those with bad credit or

                            no credit to access the finance they need to pay for bills, emergencies

                            or special occasions.</p>
                        <h2>List of Logbook Lenders</h2>

                        <p>
                            We feature a number of competitive logbook lenders on our website.

                            Below we show a list of logbook lenders that we work with and you

                            can click through to the individual page of each lender to get a better

                            idea of how much you can borrow and their lending criteria. Once

                            you have chosen the best lender for your requirements, you can click

                            through directly to their website where you can apply.
                        </p>

                            (List of logbook lenders)
                        </p>

                        <h2>How do you apply with a Logbook Lender?</h2>

                        <p>Most of the logbook loan lenders we feature on our site offer an

                            online application and the entire loan can be finalized through email

                            and over the phone. If successful, the funds can be transferred to

                            your bank account on the same day or week.</p>
                        <p>
                            We also display logbook lenders on our website that have stores on

                            the high street – so you can visit one of their outlets near you and if

                            you have all the relevant documents available, you can receive up to

                            £2,500 in cash on the same day.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What information do you need to provide to Logbook Lenders?</h2>

                        <p>Applicants are required to provide their <a href="//www.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-certificate-v5c-log-book">V5 certificate</a> or logbook to

                            the lender prior to an application. This confirms their ownership of

                            the vehicle which they wish to secure as part of the loan. Further

                            documentation required includes an up-to-date MOT certificate, tax

                            certificate, UK driving license and proof of income and employment.</p>


                        <p>The vehicle that you wish to secure on your loan must be almost

                            finance free and worth at least £500. Some logbook lenders may not

                            be able to provide finance if the vehicle is over 7 years old however

                            this depends on the quality and value of the vehicle.</p>


                        <p>Customers that apply must sign a ‘bill of sale’ which temporarily

                            hands over the ownership of the car to the logbook lender. The

                            borrower can continue using and driving the car as normal but if they

                            fall into arrears, the logbook lender can sell the car without a court

                            order.</p>

                        <h2>How much can I borrow from a Logbook Lender?</h2>

                        <p>How much you can borrow will depend on the value of your vehicle

                            and how much income you receive each month. Typically the greater

                            the value of your car and higher the income you generate, the more

                            you will be able to borrow, with some lenders offering loans of up to

                            £50,000.</p>

                        <p>
                            Newer vehicles will typically be worth more so this may also extend

                            your borrowing facility. From the lenders’ perspective, they want to

                            be able to recover the cost of their loan by giving you an amount that

                            you can afford to repay with your salary or through the sale of your

                            car. But provided your application is successful, you can receive

                            funds by cash or into your bank account on the same day or week.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How do repayments work with Logbook Lenders?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Logbook lenders provide loans that are repayable in weekly or

                            monthly instalments over 2 to 5 years. Repayments are usually

                            collected through the customer’s debit account on a scheduled

                            repayment date. Customers have the option to repay their loan early

                            and it will usually reduce the overall price of the loan for doing so.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What are the risks involved with Logbook Lenders?</h2>

                        <p>The greatest risk of a logbook loan is that your car, bike or van may

                            be repossessed if you fail to keep up with repayments. Of course, the

                            lender won’t repossess your vehicle as soon as you miss one

                            repayment. The lender will always contact you if you fall into arrears

                            and try help you repay your loan, leaving repossession as a last

                            resort.
                        </p>

                        <p> The reason for the car being repossessed is to cover the cost of what

                            you have borrowed from the lender. If the car is sold for less than

                            anticipated, you may be required to cover the shortfall in outstanding

                            debt. You will be allowed to re-purchase the car again in the future.</a>.
                        </p>
