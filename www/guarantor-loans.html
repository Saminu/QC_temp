                        <p>A guarantor loan is a unsecured loan ranging from £500 to £7,500 and can
                            last any length up to five years. The idea is that you have a second person
                            involved in the transaction that acts as your guarantor. This person could be a
                            family member or a friend and if you are unable to repay your loan on time, the
                            guarantor agrees to cover the repayment on your behalf. The interest rates for
                            a guarantor loan are much cheaper than a payday loan and there are no upfront
                            admin or arrangement fees involved in the process.</p>

                            of age, are living and working in the UK and have a working debit account.
                            Guarantor loans are typically used by those individual who have bad credit and
                            have been denied for a loan elsewhere. But this type of loan has a very high
                            acceptance rate because the lender has extra security knowing that someone else
                            can cover the cost. For this reason, customers with bad credit can usually obtain
                            much higher amounts from a guarantor loan than they can with any other loan,
                            and it gives them the opportunity to show that they can indeed pay on time and
                            this will help rebuild their credit rating.</p>

    <h2>About Guarantor Loans</h2>

    <p>The concept of having a guarantor to cover your loan is not new. The idea of
        having someone guarantee you for a repayment was very common for landlords
        and mortgages companies but has since been replaced by credit checking
        systems. The original idea was that if the guarantor is able to trust you then the
        lender feels that they can trust you too. By having that extra person to cover the
        cost reduces the risk for the lender, which means that they can grant more loans
        to people that need them.</p>
    <p>
        The growth of the guarantor loan sector has been fueled by the numerous
        payday lenders in the UK offering loans with high rates of APR that run in the
        thousands of percent. Therefore, the guarantor loan has emerged as a much
        cheaper alternative with the APR being around 50% for the most competitive
        lenders. Payday loans that only last around 30 days can put pressure on one’s
        finances to repay the entire loan and interest in one lump sum – making them
        feel squeezed at the end of the month. Guarantor loans allow customers to repay
        in monthly instalments and for a period of up to 5 years, offering a much more
        long term and flexible way to manage their finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, there is also the bonus of a higher acceptance rate for people with
        bad credit. Those that are typically turned down by bank and building societies
        for loans are able to get the unsecured credit that they need by having a strong
        person to be their guarantor. A guarantor loan lender also gives the customer
        with bad credit the opportunity to repay on time and repair their credit rating.
        This will make it easier for the individual to obtain other forms of credit in the
        future.

    <h2>How does a guarantor loan application work?</h2>

    <p>The application for the lenders we offer is completely online. To be eligible, you
        must typically be over 18 years of age, living in the UK and have a working debit
        account. An online application takes around 5 minutes to complete and you will
        be asked to enter the contact details of both the borrower and the guarantor.
        There will usually be a series of credit and affordability checks to assess your
        eligibility for the loan and if successful, you will be sent an email with a specific
        link to verify your loan. To complete the final stages, the lender may require
        a phone call or proof of a bank statement from both parties with the aim to
        transfer funds on the same day.</p>
    <p>
        You are still eligible for a loan if you have bad credit or have previously been
        bankrupt or in IVA. The lender pays specific attention to the credit rating of your
        selected guarantor and those that have demonstrated good credit by repaying
        several loans on time or being a homeowner, are more likely to be accepted.
