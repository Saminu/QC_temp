                        <p>Avant Credit offer long-term loans ranging from £500 to £20,000 that are repaid

                            in monthly instalments over 12 to 60 months. Originally from Delaware and with

                            premises in Chicago and London, Avant Credit have processed over 200,000

                            applications to date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The APR will range from 9.95% to 79.99% and will depend on how much you

                            have borrowed and how long you want the loan for. How much you can borrow

                            depends on your credit score and affordability. When you apply online, Avant

                            Credit will run a series of checks to see if you are eligible for a loan and if

                            successful, you can receive your funds on the same day.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What Are The Advantages Of Avant Credit?</h2>

                        <p>Avant Credit is a direct lender, which means that the entire application, funding

                            and collections are processed with them directly, and there are no other brokers

                            or intermediaries involved or upfront fees. All applications are completely online

                            through their secure website and customer support and funding is available 7

                            days a week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, a loan from Avant Credit is completely unsecured which means that

                            you do not have to put down anything as collateral prior to the loan such as your

                            house or car. If you are unable to repay your loan on time, it is good to know that

                            your assets do not risk repossession.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another positive is that applying for a loan will not affect your credit score. If you

                            are able to repay your loan on time, the information will be sent back to a credit

                            reference agency and this may improve your credit score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A long-term loan like the ones offered by Avant Credit allow you spread

                            repayments over time, making it more flexible than a standard payday loan. You

                            don’t have the pressure to repay in full on your next pay date so it’s a lot easier

                            to pay smaller amounts each month. If you have disposable income or wish to

                            clear your account early, you can repay early at no extra cost. In fact, it will

                            probably be cheaper to do so.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Does Repayment Work For Avant Credit?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Repayment is collected automatically each month by the lender using continuous

                            payment authority. This means that Avant Credit will have permission to collect

                            every month from your account on your repayment date so you don’t have to

                            worry about how to pay them back. They will only take the collection amount

                            outstanding and will give you notice on the days leading up to each repayment.

                            In total, three attempts on your debit account will be made on each repayment

                            date.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What is The Criteria For Avant Credit?</h2>
                        <p>
                            To be eligible for a loan with Avant Credit, you must be over the age of 18 and be

                            a resident of the UK. You must have a debit account in your name because this is

                            where the loan will be transferred to and the repayments will be collected from.

                            You do not require a guarantor for this kind of loan or need to be a homeowner.

                            Having a good credit history will increase your chances of being approved.
                        </p>
