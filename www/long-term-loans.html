            <h2>What are long term loans?</h2>

            <p>Long term loans refer to borrowing a few hundred or thousand pounds for a fixed period of

                time lasting from 5 months to 3 years. The benefit of a long-term loan over a payday loan is

                that it offers more time and flexibility to repay. Borrowers are able to receive the funds they

                require in one lump sum but repay over a longer period of time in monthly or annual

                instalments.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Quiddi, we compare long term loans online ranging from £100 to £20,000. Using our

                comparison table you can compare the loans that last a few months compared to the

                longer-term loans of up to 3 years. To apply, simply click on the lender best suited to your

                requirements and you will be taken directly to their website where you will be asked to fill

                in an application. Once the lender has run their series of checks, if you have passed

                successfully, the funds can be transferred to your account on the same day. You will not be

                required to fill in any details on our website nor will we take any fees from your account or

                pass on your details to any other companies. We provide a completely free and secure way

                to compare long term loans in the UK.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to compare the different rates and terms of the lenders we feature. All loans

                are displayed with their Representative APR which is the Annual Percentage Rate offered to

                at least 51% of successful customers. Using the repayment example provided for each

                lender will give you a good idea of how much you are expected to repay. The amount you

                can borrow will depend largely on your monthly income and previous credit history and the

                longer the loan period, the more you can borrow too.
            </p>

            <h2>Long term loans for emergencies</h2>

            <p>The loans we feature from companies such as Peachy and Satsuma are best for emergency

                expenses. Whether it is car repairs, a broken boiler or washing machine, they are the types

                of emergencies that you usually don’t anticipate and are hard to prepare for. By borrowing a

                loan for a period of 5 months and longer, you are able to receive the immediate funds

                necessary to get you back on your feet and spread the repayment over time.
            </p>

            <p>It is always advisable to have money saved for emergencies but it is still hard to prepare for

                unforeseen circumstances and sometimes you need a cash injection to see you through. The

                ease of an online application means that you can apply for a loan from wherever you are

                and receive funds on the same day. When you have an emergency, you don’t have time to

                go to your bank, queue up, post things off and wait for a response. If you need an urgent

                loan, you want to be able to apply quickly and receive funds on the same day. By using our

                long-term loan comparison tool, we give borrowers the opportunity to find same day loans

                for their emergency requirements at the best possible rates.
            </p>

            <h2>Long-term payday loans</h2>

            <p>More and more borrowers are using long-term payday loans instead of traditional payday

                loans. Many customers find that repaying the entire loan and interest on their next pay date

                can put them under financial pressure, especially when the loan is for an emergency. In

                several cases, those who take out payday loans are not able to meet repayment after 15 to

                30 days and so they are inclined to take out new loans to repay their existing debts or they

                need to rollover their loan, leading to a dramatic increase in cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is why a long-term payday loan is a more responsible option. The customer is able to

                spread repayment over 5, 6 or 12 months providing much greater flexibility. Furthermore,

                the borrower gets to keep the initial amount they borrowed for longer and having a set of

                smaller monthly instalments to repay means they have a much greater control of their

                finances.
            </p>

            <h2>Secured vs unsecured long term loans</h2>

            <p>Customers can choose between the secured and unsecured long term loans that we offer.

                Secured loans involve putting down something as collateral as part of the transaction.

                Typically, borrowers will apply for large amounts secured on their house or their car. This

                allows the lender to have security so if the customer is unable to repay, the company is

                entitled to repossess the car or house to recover cost. Secured loans are more common for

                those customers with bad credit who may have been turned down by traditional banks and

                lenders. The loan vendor will have to value your possession before transferring funds but

                having the extra security reduces the risk for the lender meaning that secured loans usually

                lead to higher amounts borrowed for a longer period of time. However, it is important to

                read the terms and conditions carefully because failing to repay on time will lead to the

                repossession of valuable collateral.
            </p>

            <p>By comparison, unsecured long-term loans do not require any form of collateral as part of

                the loan agreement. This makes unsecured loans more attractive but because there is

                greater risk on the lender, the cost of the loan is typically higher. Another advantage of

                taking out an unsecured loan is that the rate you are charged remains fixed over the loan

                period. This means that the daily or monthly rate does not change due to inflation or other

                economic factors. Borrowing a secured long-term loan may have a variable interest rate

                meaning that the lender can change the interest rate so you could pay more or less than

                initially agreed.
            </p>
