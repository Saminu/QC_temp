                    <h2>What is a Credit Report</h2>

                    <p>A credit report is a snapshot of your credit history. It contains essential

                        information regarding your previous payments made on credit including

                        mortgages, credit cards and loans. Lenders look at the information provided in

                        your credit report to assess risk and decide whether to give you a loan based on

                        their criteria.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The information is gathered by the three main credit reference agencies Equifax,

                        CallCredit and Experian. So whenever a lender checks your credit report, they

                        receive information from one of the credit reference agencies, also known as

                        credit reference bureaus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, when you apply for credit, miss or make a repayment, the information

                        if sent from your lender back to the credit reference agency. It is important that

                        the agencies have access to real-time data so that any lender you apply with can

                        assess your current financial status. Lenders are able to see things like if you

                        have too many loans open, have made several applications in a short space of

                        time or have missed repayments.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Free Credit Reports from Quiddi Compare</h2>

                    <h2>What information is included in your credit report</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your credit report is made up of several factors including your personal

                        information, credit history, number of open account and number of searches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personal information such as your name, address, national insurance number,

                        birthday and employment are recorded on your credit report. Whether you are

                        on the electoral roll is included and this is a factor that many lenders like to see

                        because it confirms your identity and address.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The credit history shows all the companies that have granted you credit

                        including mortgage companies, credit cards, banks and loan providers. The

                        information confirms when you opened various accounts, how much you

                        borrowed and how well you paid back. If you have missed repayments in the

                        past, this will remain on your file for up to 6 years. Flags will be alerted if you

                        have missed repayments or have ever had a CCJ (<a target="_blank" href="//www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/overview">County Court Judgement</a>) or

                        faced bankruptcy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A credit report will be available to anyone in the UK once they turn 18. But

                        having little or no credit can sometimes work against you as lenders have no

                        indication as to whether you are a good lending proposition. As a result, some

                        individuals find ways to build their credit rating by taking out small loans or

                        credit cards with a low credit limit and monitor the results on their credit report.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How many loans or accounts you have open will also be visible on a credit

                        report. This detail is very important to lenders and creditors because it lets them

                        know your affordability - how much you can afford and how much you can repay.

                        Particularly in the payday loan and <a href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/guarantor-loans.html">guarantor loan</a> industry, lenders cannot lend

                        to individuals with a certain number of loans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, your report shows potential lenders how many searches have been

                        made by other lenders on your account. Whenever you apply for a credit product

                        and the lender carries out a credit check, it leaves a hard search or ‘footprint’ on

                        your account confirming that they checked the account. This is different to a soft

                        search, which is not visible on your account and includes searches on the spouse

                        of an applicant. This is relevant because individuals that have a lot of hard

                        searches in a short space of time look like they have made a lot of applications

                        since numerous lenders have been searching their report. This may demonstrate

                        that the person is desperate for funds and may not be a suitable candidate for a

                        loan.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Why should you check your credit report?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Millions of people in the UK check their credit reports on a regular basis and

                        there are some very important reasons for doing so:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Get better rates for mortgages and loans:</strong> Lenders look at your credit report to

                        make an assessment of  your creditworthiness. Depending on how well you have

                        paid other lines of credit in the past, lenders will decide what interest rate to

                        charge you with better candidates receiving lower rates of interest because they

                        are deemed as less risk. So if you are looking at big purchases like buying a car or

                        you wish to <a target="_blank" href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/mortgage.html">apply for a mortgage</a>, it is important to check that your credit report

                        is accurate in order to get the best rate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Check any inaccuracies:</strong> Unfortunately, some loan providers and companies we

                        deal with provide the wrong data on our credit reports, perhaps saying that you

                        repaid late when this wasn’t the case. Sometimes this happens by the lender as a

                        mistake but can also happen to people who have a popular name or have

                        relatives with a similar name. Looking at your credit report will allow you to

                        point out any incorrect information and raise it with the provider so that you can

                        get the credit and interest rates that you deserve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Check fraudulent activity:</strong> A credit report alerts you if any lenders have made

                        searches on your account and this includes any fraudulent behaviour. If you have

                        been unlucky and someone has stolen your cards or details and is applying for

                        loans or credit in your name, a credit report will be able to tell you this.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Annual credit report</h3>
                    <p>
                        An annual credit report is available from the leading credit reference agencies

                        and you are entitled to receive a free copy once a year. However, this is only

                        available in the United States for free and in the UK, you have to pay for an

                        annual credit report with a subscription of small monthly payments. For a free

                        credit report, you can take advantage of a free trial offered by our various

                        providers or you can gain access to a statutory credit report explained below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Statutory Credit Report</h3>
                    <p>
                        Credit reference agencies allow you to access a statutory credit report for only

                        £2. This provides a one-off snapshot that gives you insight into your credit report

                        and allows you to take note of any discrepancies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The statutory credit report contains includes information on your personal

                        details, financial links, whether you are on the electoral roll, your credit payment

                        history and a list of recent searches on your file. Everyone in the UK has a legal

                        right to receive a statutory credit report once a year.
                    </p>
