                        <h1>The impact on your credit score</h1>

                        <p>Most of the long term lenders we feature will run a credit check on your account prior to
                            approving

                            your loan. By running a standard credit check through a credit reference bureau like
                            Experian,

                            Equifax or CallCredit, the lender is given an insight into your previous repayment
                            performance for

                            other lines of credit such as credit cards, personal loans and car loans. If you have failed
                            to keep up

                            with repayments in the past, you will likely have a low credit score compared to someone who

                            regularly repays on time who will have a high credit score.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some of the lenders we featured that offer secured loans will be less likely to run a credit
                            check on

                            your account. Usually, the lender runs credit checks to get a better idea of how well you
                            have paid

                            your other loans but if the loan is secured on something like your car or house, this is
                            sufficient

                            security for the lender. Below we explain in greater detail how the credit checks involved
                            impact

                            your credit file and your credit score.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Leave a footprint on your credit file</h2>

                        <p>Once the lender runs a credit check on you, it leaves something known as a ‘footprint’ on
                            your credit

                            file. There is no cost incurred, it is simply a visible mark that confirms that you applied
                            with a lender

                            and will be removed after 12 months. The idea is that other lenders who run a credit check
                            on you

                            will be able to see all the footprints over the last year. So if you have made a lot of
                            applications, the

                            lender will be able to see based on the number of footprints. Making several applications
                            with lots of

                            different lenders may affect your chances of being approved for a loan. Lots of searches on
                            your

                            account suggest you may be desperate for funds or have been declined numerous times
                            elsewhere.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Failing to repay will lower your credit score</h2>

                        <p>
                            If you fail to meet any repayment, the information from the lender will be fed back to the
                            credit

                            reference agency. By missing a repayment, it will be recorded negatively on your credit file
                            and this

                            may lower your credit score. Since other lenders may run a credit check on your account in
                            the

                            future, they will be able to see that you have failed to repay a loan and this may make it
                            harder to

                            obtain finance in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By not repaying an unsecured loan will also negatively affect your credit rating. Although
                            you are at

                            risk of losing your collateral such as your car or house, the information is sent back to
                            the credit

                            reference agencies and reflected on your credit score to ensure that you do not have easy
                            access to

                            other forms of high-cost borrowing. If you seriously fall behind on payment, this could
                            eventually

                            lead to a CCJ (County Court Judgement), which will dramatically impact your credit score.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Repaying on time will better your credit score</h2>

                        <p>
                            By comparison, repaying your loan on time may improve your credit score. Keeping within the
                            loan

                            agreement will reflect positively when the information is fed back to your credit file. This
                            will make

                            you a better borrowing prospect and may make it easier to access finance in the future.
                            However, it

                            is important to note that high-cost borrowing should not be used specifically for building
                            your credit

                            rating.
