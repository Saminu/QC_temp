                        <h1>What happens if you cannot repay?</h1>

                        <p>We appreciate that circumstances can change and you may not be able to make repayment. This

                            might be because you haven’t been paid by work yet or an emergency has occurred leaving you

                            short of funds for that month. However, not being able to repay your loan could lead to
                            charges

                            being incurred and significantly increasing the cost of the loan. To avoid this, the lenders
                            we feature

                            will typically send you a text message and email on the days leading up to each instalment
                            to give

                            you good time get your finances ready for collection. In addition, if you know that you are
                            unable to

                            repay a loan, the lender should be able to offer forbearance and be able to help you reduce
                            the cost

                            of your loan or repay at a later date. Below we explain the various options and outcomes if
                            you

                            cannot repay your loan.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Secured loans could lead to repossession of collateral</h2>

                        <p>Since a secured loan involves putting down something as collateral like your car or house,
                            you risk

                            losing this if you fail to meet repayment. The ‘bill of sale’ that is agreed during the
                            application stage

                            confirms the lender can repossess your goods if payment is not made. The lender will always
                            contact

                            you first by email, phone and post and try to come to an arrangement before repossessing
                            your

                            items.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Default fees and charges</h2>

                        <p>
                            The lenders we feature charge a default fee of up to £15 for a late repayment. The fee will
                            not be

                            applicable if the customer repays later on the day of collection. In addition to the default
                            fee, the

                            lender will typically charge a daily interest rate of around 0.8% per day for each day the
                            loan has not

                            been repaid. You will always receive reminders by email or phone explaining the extra costs
                            involved

                            but it is always advisable to pay on time or contact the lender if you know that you are
                            unable to

                            repay.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Pay plan or arrangement</h2>

                        <p>
                            If you contact the lender and explain your circumstances, they may be able to offer you a
                            pay plan or

                            arrangement on the current terms of your loan. A pay plan involves paying lower amounts over
                            a

                            longer period of time and this should make the loan easier to repay. However, the option of
                            having a

                            pay plan available should not encourage you to take out a loan if you know in advance that
                            you

                            cannot repay. Being in an arrangement may still be reflected on your credit score because it

                            indicates that you failed to keep up with repayments.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            Negative impact to your credit score
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Failing to repay will have a negative impact on your credit score. This means that other
                            lenders that

                            run a credit check on your account will see that you have not made a payment in the past and

                            therefore it might make it harder to obtain credit in the future. In contrast, repaying your
                            loan on

                            time may improve your credit score and make it easier to access finance in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            Rollovers and extensions
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Some of the lenders we feature may be able to offer rollovers or extensions on your loan.
                            This will

                            increase the length of the loan but you will be charged extra interest making the loan more
                            costly.

                            Rollovers have been limited to two per customer per loan in order to reduce the overall
                            cost.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            Things to avoid
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            If you are unable to repay your loan, there are responsible ways you can reduce cost and the
                            impact

                            to your credit score. Customers are advised not to take out new loans in order to repay
                            their

                            outstanding loans because this prolongs the repayment and may lead to a spiral of debt. In
                            addition,

                            borrowers are encouraged to communicate actively with the lenders and to respond to phone
                            calls

                            and emails. The lender may be able to offer flexibility if you explain your financial
                            situation and this

                            may reduce the cost of your loan.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before you apply for your loan with one of our lenders, it is important to consider how you
                            plan to

                            repay your loan. The loans we feature are intended for emergency expenses and borrowers
                            should

                            consider how they plan to repay the loan and interest before they apply. For help, go
