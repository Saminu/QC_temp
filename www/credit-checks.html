                    <h2>What is a credit check?</h2>

                    <p>A credit check provides lending companies with information that helps them

                        decide whether or not to offer you a loan. The data from the credit check will

                        give lenders a better idea of your financial situation by looking at your credit

                        history and how well you have paid other cards, loans, have been bankrupt or

                        had a CCJ.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Loan companies will run a credit check on your account with <a href="//www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/credit-reference">data provided from

                        credit reference agencie</a>s such as Equifax, Experian and CallCredit. Every time

                        your apply for a loan product or make repayment, the information from the

                        lenders is sent to the credit reference agencies. This means your credit score is

                        constantly being updated in real-time to provide loan companies the most

                        accurate data possible.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How do loans companies use credit checks?</h2>

                    <p>
                        When a loan company runs a credit check, they are presented with a credit rating

                        or credit score and this gives a numerical representation of your current

                        financial situation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lenders will use the information from credit checks to decide whether or not to

                        give you a loan. By gaining insight into your credit history, lenders can assess

                        your suitability for their product and how likely it is that you are going to meet

                        repayments or default.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A credit check can show if a customer has a history of CCJs and bankruptcy and

                        how suitable they are for a high cost loan. Equally, a credit check shows if an

                        applicant has made numerous loan applications in a short space of time,

                        suggesting that they are desperate for funds. The checks show what other forms

                        of credit the customer has open and having too many open loans or credit cards

                        will impact the final loan decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the credit reference checks not only tell the lender whether or not they

                        should provide the loan to the customer but also what rate. Those customers

                        with better credit ratings are more likely to receive better interest rates

                        because they are low risk of default. This is compared to those with poor credit

                        ratings who are likely to pay a higher interest rate because there is a greater

                        chance of missing repayment. The way your credit score impacts the rate you

                        pay is very common for <a href="https://quiddicompare.co.uk/mortgage">mortgage loan applications</a> and <a href="//quiddicompare.co.uk/peer-to-peer-lending.html">peer to peer lending</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why do I need to check my credit rating?</h2>

                    <p>
                        It is important to check your credit rating because it regularly goes up and down

                        based on your repayment history. Millions of people in the UK check their credit

                        ratings on a daily basis for the following reasons:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To see why you’ve been declined: If you have been declined for a specific loan

                        but you aren’t sure why, it could be due to your credit rating. You may find that

                        you have a low score which is why you have not been granted the loans you were

                        hoping for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To improve your credit rating: If you discover that your credit rating is not as

                        high as it should be and you are taking steps to improve your score, you can use

                        a credit-checking tool to constantly check your progress. Some individuals need

                        to improve their credit rating to be approved for certain loans, buy a property or

                        increase their credit limit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A lender might have reported something incorrectly: Upon checking your

                        credit history, you may find that a lender or card company that you have worked

                        with has reported data incorrect i.e a missed repayment. By checking through a

                        credit reference agency, you are able to confirm the name of the company and

                        get in touch.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fraud: If you have suffered from fraud in the past, it may have impacted your

                        credit score. This can happen, for example, if your cards were stolen and the

                        fraudster went into your unauthorised overdraft. You will want to ensure that

                        your credit score doesn’t suffer which is why is important to check regularly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Receive alerts: Signing up with a credit reference agency will allow you receive

                        alerts on your mobile phone and email every time a credit check is run on your

                        account. This is useful to confirm which loans you have applied for but above all,

                        you will be contacted for any suspicious behaviour on your account.
                    </p>
