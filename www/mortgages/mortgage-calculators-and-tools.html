            <h2>Mortgage Repayment Calculator</h2>
            <h2>How to use our free mortgage payment calculator</h2>
            <p>
                Simply enter the price of the property you have in mind, your savings, monthly income and the number of years you require the loan for. We will then be able to match you with some of the leading mortgage providers in the UK so you can get a good idea of what size mortgage you require and the interest rate you are likely to be charged.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are wondering how much can I borrow, our mortgage calculator can tell you what loan-to-value (LTV) you need. This works by assessing your current savings and the LTV is the percentage of the property that you need to borrow from the mortgage provider. For instance, if your property is worth £500,000 and you have £100,000 in savings, you will therefore require a loan of £400,000 which means you will need an 80% LTV.
            </p>
            <h2>Mortgage affordability calculator lets you know what you can afford (H2)</h2>
            <p>
                Our free mortgage-borrowing calculator is a great tool for anyone looking to apply for a mortgage that needs to know how much they can afford. A mortgage is a fantastic way to get on the property ladder and can be a very good investment. But because of the calculations involved, it can be hard to know at a glance just how much you can afford and whether you have the funds for the particular property that you have your eye on.
                By assessing your savings and earnings, our mortgage calculator lets you know what property value you can afford. If you are a first time buyer or looking to move into your next property, you need to know what size mortgage you require and what your repayments will be. By getting a better idea of monthly repayments, homeowners are able to budget month by month and keep their finances in order.
            </p>
            <h2>Mortgage Overpayment Calculator</h2>
            <p>
                A mortgage overpayment calculator lets you know how much you can save by overpaying your mortgage if you make early repayments. You will typically have a set repayment each month for the mortgage term, usually around 25 years. However, if you have disposable income, you are able to contribute towards repaying your mortgage early. Since the interest accumulates the longer you have the loan, overpaying on your mortgage will allow you to reduce the cost of your loan and save money.
            </p>
            <p>
                An overpayment calculator lets you know how much you will save by paying early. Mortgage lenders generally allow you to overpay by a maximum of 10% per month so this is usually included in the calculation.
            </p>

                We have partnered with the leading mortgage companies in the UK so for whatever type of mortgage you have in mind, you are able to compare the different rates and see what is the best deal for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final calculation is a strong guideline but don’t forget that there are other factors that will determine whether your mortgage application is successful and the rate that you will be charged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those individuals with a good credit history will generally receive a lower interest rate from their lender because they have proved that they have repaid other types of loans on time and are therefore seen as a low risk of default. Similarly, those with a steady level of income and long-term employment are more likely to be approved by the lender and be quoted a lower interest rate and a higher loan-to-value. If you are an existing customer with a mortgage lender and have repaid successfully each month, they are likely to reward your loyalty with a good rate should you require another mortgage from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mortgage calculator is completely free for customers to use and by pairing you with our mortgage providers, you are one step closer to purchasing the property of your dreams.
