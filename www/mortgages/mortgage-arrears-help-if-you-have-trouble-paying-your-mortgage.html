                        <h1>Mortgage Arrears Help</h1>

                        <p>If you need help repaying your mortgage or find that you’re in account is in arrears, there
                            are several options available to get you back on your feet. We understand that one’s
                            financial circumstances can change month to month due to emergency expenses or a sudden drop
                            income and so it might be difficult to keep up with monthly repayments. Fortunately there
                            are ways to overcome mortgage arrears and below we discuss the best ways to repay your
                            mortgage including government schemes, insurance and speaking to your mortgage provider.</p>

                        <h2>Contact your mortgage provider</h2>

                        <p>It is important that you contact your mortgage provider before you realize that you cannot
                            pay or you may be charged additional fees for your account going into arrears. By speaking
                            to your lender, they should be able to offer your ‘forbearance’ and this means that they can
                            offer ways to help make the repayments more manageable.</p>

                        <p>Lenders can reduce the cost of your mortgage by offering lower monthly repayments or allow
                            you to defer repayment for a month also known as a ‘mortgage payment holiday.’ If you have
                            previously overpaid on your mortgage, you may be on track overall and therefore the lender
                            may allow you to take a break from your monthly repayment schedule.</p>

                        <h2>Reduce the cost of your mortgage by switching repayment options</h2>

                        <p>Mortgages are portable meaning that borrowers can change the type of mortgage they have to
                            make the repayment options more flexible. For example, you can switch your current mortgage
                            to an interest only mortgage, which means that you will pay lower monthly repayments by only
                            paying the interest and leaving the capital to be repaid at the end of the mortgage
                            term.</p>

                        <p>An additional option is to ask your lender to extend the mortgage term. If your loan
                            currently lasts for 25 years, you can ask the lender to extend the mortgage for 40 years.
                            This will reduce the monthly repayments in the short term and help if your account is
                            currently in arrears. However, extending the length of the mortgage will mean that the loan
                            is open for longer and therefore will increase the overall cost.</p>

                        <h2>Sell your home and rent it out</h2>

                        <p>If you don’t think that your financial situation will improve in the near future, you could
                            sell your property or rent it out to the public to recover your debt. This is seen as a
                            better alternative to incurring further arrears charges or potential repossession of your
                            home.</p>

                        <h2>Mortgage insurance</h2>

                        <p>Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance (MPPI) is available to cover the cost of your mortgage
                            should you have an accident, fall ill or become unemployed as a result. MPPI is available to
                            purchase in the early stages of your mortgage and it is worth checking your mortgage
                            agreement to see if you already have this. MPPI can also acquired during the mortgage term
                            but you are less likely to be eligible if you are already injured, sick or unemployed.</p>

                        <p>Individuals will not be able to claim this type if currently fit, healthy and working.
                            Therefore, if you are struggling with your mortgage payments but are still employed, it will
                            not help reduce the cost of your monthly repayments.</p>

                        <h2>Government schemes to help repay your mortgage</h2>

                        <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/support-for-mortgage-interest/overview" target="_new">Support for
                            Mortgage Interest</a> (SMI) means the government will pay only the interest of your loan and
                            not the capital. The government can offer help with the first £200,000 of your outstanding
                            mortgage until you are in a financial position to repay. To be eligible, individuals must be
                            on income support such as job seekers’ allowance (JSA).</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/mortgage-rescue-scheme" target="_new">The Mortgage to Shared
                            Equity Scheme</a> is available for those that have experienced payment shocks such as a
                            drastic change in their income. With this scheme, borrowers are able to sell part of their
                            property to the government to raise funds and they will have the option to buy it back later
                            on. It is available to those that have been in mortgage arrears for over 3 months, own at
                            least 25% of their property and have less than £2,000 worth of savings. The value of your
                            house will be taken into consideration and must be above a certain level. </p>

                        <p>Individuals may be eligible for other schemes based on their criteria and location. For more

                        <h3>Create a budget to manage your mortgage repayments</h3>

                        <p>One of the simplest ways to manage your mortgage your repayments is to put together a budget
                            and prioritize all your debts. Start by devising a list of your outgoings and try to cut out
                            the non-essentials such as holidays, taxis, coffee and smoking. There are several ways to
                            decrease your monthly home costs by switching providers for broadband, heating, gas and
                            electricity. Using comparison sites is a great way to save on your utility and supermarket
                            bills. You can use our own comparison tables if you want to get better rates on <a

                                accounts</a> and credit cards.</p>

                        <h3>Do not apply for other loans</h3>

                        <p>If you are struggling to make your mortgage repayments, customers are advised not to apply
                            for further loans to repay the outstanding balance. Taking out other personal loans will
                            simply delay the repayment and may lead to a spiral of debt. Furthermore, applying for a
                            number of additional loans may negatively impact one’s credit score as it suggests that the
                            individual is financially stretched and desperate for finance. This may worsen the
                            individual’s credit rating further if they have fallen into arrears from missing their
                            mortgage repayments. </p>
