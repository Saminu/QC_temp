                        <h1>What are the risks of a second charge mortgage?</h1>

                        <p>Whilst getting a second mortgage can be a very tempting way to raise finance,
                            there are several risks associated with getting another mortgage on top of your
                            existing one. Anyone who has a mortgage already will know that there are severe
                            consequences if you can’t keep up with repayments as mentioned below:</p>

                        <h2>Repossession of your property</h2>

                        <p>This is the biggest risk involved if you cannot keep up with your monthly
                            collections. If you fail to make the monthly repayments for your mortgage on
                            time and have used up your repayment holidays, the mortgage company can
                            repossess one or two properties. The bank will sell the house at market value to
                            recover your outstanding balance and pay you the difference of anything left
                            over.</p>

                        <p>If you have two mortgages for two different properties, the loan providers will
                            always collect from your initial mortgage first. As a result, you will always
                            prioritize payments for the home where you live even if it means losing your
                            second property.</p>

                        <h2>Spiral of debt</h2>

                        <p>If you have an existing mortgage on your home, the loan providers will be able to
                            get an idea of your finances and whether you can afford a second home
                            mortgage.</p>

                        <p>The financial burden of two mortgages can lead to a spiral of debt if the
                            homeowners cannot keep up with repayment. Over a long period of time, it could
                            lead to potential bankruptcy, IVA or a CCJ. Before applying, it is important to look
                            carefully at your finances including your income and expenses.</p>

                        <p>
                            If you are applying for a second charge mortgage to pay for a big purchase like a
                            wedding or a car, it is important to look at the costs very carefully because if you
                            go over budget, you may not be able to make your repayments on time or you
                            may find yourself financially squeezed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is also worth estimating the cost of any emergencies or the possibility of you or
                            your spouse losing your job and how this will impact your ability to repay on
                            time.
                        </p>

                        <h2>If you can’t keep up with repayments, it could affect your credit rating</h2>

                        <p>
                            With an additional mortgage, there are extra monthly repayments and if you
                            miss any payments without a ‘payment holiday,’ this will negatively impact your
                            credit score.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every time you make a payment, whether it’s successful or not, the information
                            is sent from the mortgage company to a credit reference bureau such as
                            Experian, Equifax or Call Credit. It is important that your payment history for any
                            type of credit or loan is recorded because other lenders will have access to this
                            information and will be informed of your payment history.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Having a negative mark on your credit file can make it more difficult to access
                            finance elsewhere as lenders see you as a greater risk. Equally, a poor credit
                            rating could make the cost of new loans more expensive as lenders adjust the
                            interest rate to mitigate risk.
                        </p>

                        <h3>It could be better to remortgage</h3>

                        <p>
                            One mustn’t be lured by the sound of getting a second mortgage. Depending on
                            your current mortgage terms, you could be better off getting a remortgage. This
                            is something we also offer at Quiddi Compare – working with top mortgage
                            providers in the UK, we offer a range of remortgaging deals. This involves
                            switching your current mortgage to a different product either with a new or
                            existing lender. The idea is that you may be able to take advantage of
                            introductory deals offered by a new mortgage contract and be able to save
                            hundreds or thousands of pounds in the process.
