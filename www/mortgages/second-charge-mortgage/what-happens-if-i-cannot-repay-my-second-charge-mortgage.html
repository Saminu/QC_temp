                        <p>At Quiddi Compare, we understand that one’s financial circumstances can change
                            and you may not be able to keep up with the repayments of two mortgages. For
                            many, keeping up with the payments for one mortgage is stressful enough, let
                            alone the cost of two mortgages.</p>

                        <p>Whether it’s falling ill or losing your job, you never know when an emergency
                            can strike and how it can impact your finances. For whatever situation, it is
                            important to know the outcomes of what happens if you cannot repay your
                            second charge mortgage. Below we highlight the most likely implications of non-
                            repayment and what are the most sensible things to do if you cannot repay:
                        </p>

                        <h2>The implications of non-repayment</h2>

                        <h3>Repossession</h3>

                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fla.org.uk/">The Finance and Leasing Association</a>
                            recorded that 827 homes in the UK were
                            repossessed in 2011 due to failed repayments for second charge mortgages. This
                            is the most serious outcome of failing to pay your mortgage. After a number of
                            missed repayments, the bank will be able to repossess your property since a
                            mortgage is secured on your home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But the way repossession works is slightly different for second mortgages when
                            compared to standard mortgages or other secured loans such as logbook loans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Firstly, even if you make all the payments for your first mortgage on time, your
                            main residential home could still be repossessed if you do not keep up with
                            payments on your second mortgages. This is because having a second charge
                            mortgages means having two mortgages on your first property.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the event that the bank repossesses your property, they will sell it at market

                            value to cover the cost of your outstanding balance. The first mortgage is always

                            paid off first and any remaining balance is put towards paying off the second

                            mortgage. If the money leftover from the sale of your house does not cover the

                            cost of your second mortgage, <strong>you will still be liable to pay the balance</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Damage to your credit score</h3>

                        <p>
                            Missing repayments on your mortgage will be recorded on your credit file. The

                            information is sent from the mortgage company to a credit reference agency

                            (CRA) who updates your credit rating and your credit score can fall.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you apply for any other loans, the lenders that run a credit check on your

                            account will be able to see that you have missed your repayments and they will

                            use this to assess the risk of providing you a loan. In fact, it may be harder to

                            access other types of loans and credit if you have payments that are in arrears.

                            For some loans, the interest rate you pay may be higher to accommodate the risk

                            of default.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even if you miss a few mortgage repayments, if you are eventually able to pay off

                            your debts, the information will still be sent to the CRAs and this can rebuild

                            your credit rating over time.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Late fees</h3>

                        <p>
                            Mortgage companies may charge late fees for missed repayment regardless of

                            whether it falls on your first or second mortgages. The fees involved include the

                            monthly arrears fee which is a flat fee each month.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you have missed numerous payments and the lender needs to take legal action,

                            they may pass on to the solicitor fees to your account.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If the event that your property is repossessed, the mortgage company may

                            charge you ‘repossession fees’ for any legal work involved in the resale of your

                            estate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To limit the potential late fees, you can pursue the options explained below.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What to do if you can’t repay</h2>

                        <h3>Speak to your mortgage provider</h3>

                        <p>As soon as you know that you won’t be able to make your monthly payments, it

                            is essential to call your mortgage provide to discuss your options. Some

                            mortgage companies are able to provide forbearance by lowering your monthly

                            fee or removing any late charges.</p>

                        <p>
                            In some cases, you can discuss a way to combine your two mortgages into one

                            deal which might be easier to afford. Either way, it is important to speak to your

                            mortgage company as soon as you realize that you are experiencing financial

                            difficulty and the last thing you should do is avoid the problem.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Take a payment holiday</h3>

                        <p>
                            Depending on the company that provides your mortgage, you may be able to take

                            what is known as a ‘payment holiday’ whereby you are allowed to skip next

                            month’s payment at no extra charge. This will not affect your credit score or

                            increase the cost of your loan.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, it does mean that the payment is just pushed forward until next month

                            meaning that you will have more to pay next time payment is due. So it doesn’t

                            solve the problem, but if you are expecting some more income over the next few

                            weeks such as commission or a bonus from work, it can be a viable solution.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Check if you have PPI</h3>

                        <p>
                            We’re all fed up of the phone calls about miss sold PPI – but it can come in handy.

                            If you have not been able to pay your first or second mortgage as a result of

                            losing your job or because you have fallen ill, you can claim the loss of income

                            through PPI.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Protection Insurance</a> and you may have added it to your

                            mortgage scheme when you applied. Be sure to check the small print on your

                            mortgage document to see if it applies.
