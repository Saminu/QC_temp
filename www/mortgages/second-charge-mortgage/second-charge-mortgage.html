                        <h2>What is a second charge mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>A second charge mortgage involves getting a loan that is secured on any property
                            you own (both investment buy to let properties and your residential property)
                            your home in addition to your main mortgage. It can be used to raise finance on
                            your existing property or finance a new property that is different to your
                            residential home.</p>

                        <p>
                            Essentially, it’s like having two mortgages on the same home – and if you fail to
                            keep up with repayments on your second charge loan, your first property may be
                            at risk of repossession.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Commonly known as ‘second home mortgages,’ it is a very fast growing industry
                            in the UK and typically used by homeowners to raise money for home
                            improvements, large purchases, debt consolidation or investment purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A number of ‘buy to let’ investors have been using second charge mortgages for
                            years as their ‘secret source of funds’ but now it is of particular significance.
                            Why?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2008 when the financial crisis took hold the Bank of England rapidly reduced
                            the base rate to less than 1%. This meant that a number of property owners and
                            property investors saw their repayments on their current mortgage drastically
                            reduce. Many property owners had equity tied up in their property portfolio; but
                            there was a problem. To release the equity they would have to re-mortgage their
                            property and lose the highly favorable rate they were currently on with their
                            existing lender. The arrival of second charge mortgages solved this problem.
                            Now a property owner could retain their existing mortgage rate with their
                            existing lender but still release some or all of the equity in the property with a
                            second charge mortgage.

                        <h2>How much interest will I pay?</h2>
                        <p>The average interest rate is around 4.95% but this rate has been decreasing over
                            time as second charge mortgages have been become more main stream and
                            mortgage providers have become more competitive. How much you will pay for
                            your second mortgage will depend on your loan to value (LTV) and how much
                            equity you have in your first property to put towards your second mortgage.</p>
                        <p>
                            The interest rate for your second mortgage will usually be a little more because
                            your first mortgage repayments must always be satisfied first. So lenders
                            consider that if you have any financial issues, you will be more likely to pay for
                            your first mortgage than your second – so slightly higher interest rates allows
                            them to manage the risk of default.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How is a second charge mortgage different to a remortgage?</h2>

                        <p>A second charge mortgage is different to remortgaging because it allows you to
                            raise finance for an additional property whilst keeping your existing lender and
                            the mortgage rate you are on with them in place whereas remortgaging is
                            commonly used to get a completely new mortgage deal on your existing homethe
                            properties you own. Since the base rate and interest rates change from year to
                            year, homeowners consider remortgaging as a way to find a better rate and take
                            advantage of the introductory schemes offered by mortgage providers. Read

                        <h2>When is a second charge mortgage a good idea?</h2>

                        <p>If you have a lot of equity in your current property and are on a very good
                            mortgage interest rate with your existing lender, a second charge loan will allow
                            you to borrow a larger amount without changing your existing lender and at very
                            competitive rates. This can be a great way to raise finance for any extensions or
                            additions you would like to make to your house or pay off any outstanding debts.
                        </p>

                        <p>Getting a second charge mortgage is a good idea if your current deal makes its
                            very expensive for you to remortgage. Due to high early payment charges in your
                            contract, it could be more beneficial to get a second charge mortgage rather than
                            opt out of your current contract and remortgage.</p>
                        <p>
                            If the credit rating of you or your partner has worsened since you started your
                            first charge mortgage, you could pay a higher rate to remortgage. Since a second
                            charge mortgage uses the equity from your first property, you may be able to
                            access better rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, if your credit rating or circumstances make it hard to apply for a
                            personal loan, it may be easier to get the money you need through a second
                            charge loan that is secured on your house.
                        </p>
                        <h2>When is a second charge mortgage a bad idea?</h2>

                        <p>A second charge loan is not recommended for those already struggling to keep
                            up with their first mortgage repayments. Failing to keep up with repayments can
                            lead to repossession of your home, increases default charges and have a negative
                            impact on your credit score. With this in mind, if you are finding it hard to keep
                            up with your current mortgage plan, it can be very risky to take on the
                            responsibility of a second mortgage.</p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, whilst a second mortgage can be a good way to raise money to
                            consolidate your debts, one’s personal financial
                            situation should be taken into consideration beforehand. Whilst accessing
                            finance can help pay off other loans and credit cards, you have to think about a
                            way to pay off the second mortgage too. By using this secured loan to pay off
                            debts, you are taking outstanding payments that are unsecured and making them
                            secured and if you fail to keep up, your property could be at serious risk.

                        <h4>Ask for permission</h4>
                        <p>Finally, you may need to ask your current mortgage provider for permission to
                            take out a second mortgage. Some mortgage companies have restrictions in their
                            policies and they don’t want you to take out a second mortgage so it is always
                            worth asking before you apply.</p>
