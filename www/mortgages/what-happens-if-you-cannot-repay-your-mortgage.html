                        <h1>What happens if you cannot repay your mortgage</h1>

                        <p>If you are behind on your mortgage repayments, your account will go into something known as
                            ‘arrears.’ There are very serious implications if you miss your repayments so it is
                            important that you are aware of the increase in costs, risk to your property and the impact
                            on your credit rating.</p>

                        <p>We appreciate that one’s financial circumstances can change which means that you may not be
                            able to keep up with mortgage repayments. It could be that due to an emergency expense or
                            being paid late from work that you were unable to keep up. In the paragraphs below, we
                            explain the outcomes of non-payment and what things to expect.</p>

                        <h2>Repossession of your property</h2>

                        <p>The bank or mortgage provider may repossess your property if you are severely behind on your
                            repayments and no repayment agreement has been made after the lender has contacted you.
                            Repossession of your property means that you will be asked to leave your estate and the bank
                            will sell your property to the public to try cover the cost of your mortgage. This is a very
                            serious outcome of falling behind on mortgage repayments and can be avoided by following our
                            guidance for mortgage arrears help.</p>

                        <p>With regards to the repossession, the bank will pay you the difference if the house is sold
                            for more than the outstanding balance you owe. However, if the house is bought for less than
                            the repayment amount you owe, you will still be entitled to pay off the remaining debt. This
                            is known as the shortfall debt.</p>

                        <h2>Extra charges for late mortgage repayment</h2>

                        <p>In addition to the outstanding balance you owe for your mortgage, lenders will charge further
                            arrears fees due to late repayment. There are several different types of fees that may apply
                            for late repayment.</p>

                        <p>A <strong>monthly arrears fee</strong> may be charged each month until the balance is
                            cleared. This fee is intended to cover the cost of the lender following up your repayments
                            including letters, phone calls and time taken to manage your arrears.</p>

                        <p><strong>Solicitor or litigation fees</strong> may be charged if the lender takes legal action
                            in order to secure your repayment. This may involve lawyer letters, personal visits to your
                            home or if the case is taken to court.</p>

                        <p><strong>Repossession fees</strong> refer to the costs incurred for the mortgage company
                            managing your property once it has been repossessed and for organsing the sale of the
                            property to cover the cost of your mortgage.</p>

                        <p>How much is charged for missing repayment will vary between each mortgage lender. The
                            important thing to note is that there are additional charges that apply on top of the
                            mortgage repayment that you already owe. Borrowers are advised to contact their mortgage
                            provider in advance if they believe that they will have trouble repayment and the company
                            may be able to offer forbearance such as a mortgage holiday or lower monthly repayments.</p>

                        <h2>How mortgage repayments impact your credit score</h2>

                        <p>Failing to repay your mortgage on time may negatively impact your credit rating. Your credit
                            score is formulated based on how well you have paid current and previous loans including
                            personal loans, credit cards and mortgages. Failing to repay on time causes may cause your
                            credit score to fall. The information that you defaulted is sent from the mortgage lender to
                            a credit reference agency such as Experian or CallCredit. This information is available to
                            other lenders and may compromise your ability to gain finance elsewhere. The reason that the
                            data is shared is to ensure that someone who has missed repayment has a mark on their credit
                            file and is therefore not able to keep borrowing from different vendors.</p>

                        <p>An interesting thing to note is that failing to keep up with mortgage repayments will allow
                            negatively impact the credit rating of other people involved in that mortgage. So if you
                            have a joint mortgage with a spouse, family member or friend and you miss a repayment, it
                            will also affect their score.</p>

                        <p>To avoid a negative impact to your score, repaying your mortgage payments on time will cause
                            your credit rating to maintain its current status or allow your score to increase. By having
                            a high credit rating, you are able to access finance much easier and at more competitive
                            rates than those with bad credit.</p>
