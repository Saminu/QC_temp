                    <h2>What is a shared ownership mortgage?</h2>

                    <p>Shared ownership mortgages allow you to part-buy and part-rent your home from a local housing
                        association. It works by purchasing a ‘share’ of your chosen property of usually 25% to 75% and
                        then paying rent to the housing association for the remaining share that you do not own. When
                        compared to putting down a 25% deposit on a typical mortgage, a shared ownership mortgage allows
                        you to put down only 5% of the value of the property which is why it is a very popular solution
                        to affordable housing.</p>

                    <h2>Shared ownership mortgage example</h2>

                    <p>With a typical 5% deposit, you will only have to put down an initial £10,000 if your property is
                        valued at £200,000. This is significantly lower than a typical deposit of 25%, which would
                        equate to £50,000. Those that take part in a shared ownership mortgage will also be required to
                        pay rent to the housing association of 3% a year which in this example would be around £6,000
                        per annum. Tenants will also be required to pay a service charge on a monthly basis, which will
                        vary between properties.</p>

                    <h2>Shared ownership properties</h2>

                    <p>Shared ownership properties are ideal for affordable housing and for those that cannot afford to
                        buy a property or put down a big deposit. A shared ownership mortgage is one of the most
                        affordable ways to get on the property ladder in the UK and be able to afford a larger property
                        than you would otherwise. All shared ownership properties are leasehold properties lasting a
                        fixed period of 99 years.</p>

                    <p>A further advantage is that if you can generate savings over time, you can purchase more shares
                        in the property from the housing association. Buying more shares in the property is known as <a
                                href="http://www.originhousing.org.uk/buy/faqitem-51-what-is-staircasing.aspx"
                                target="_new">‘staircasing’</a> and can eventually lead to the individual owning the
                        property outright. Each time you apply to buy more shares in the property, the housing
                        association will value the property again so depending on the current market rates, the price of
                        the shares may be cheaper or more expensive to buy.</p>

                    <h2>Where can I find shared ownership mortgage lenders and</h2>

                    <p>Shared ownership mortgage schemes are typically available through housing associations as
                        mentioned, but also government schemes and banks. The most common scheme is known as <a
                                href="http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/" target="_new">Help to Buy</a> and other well-known
                        participating banks include Nationwide, Halifax and Santander.</p>

                    <h2>Am I eligible for a shared ownership mortgage scheme?</h2>

                    <p>To be eligible, you must be able to put down a minimum of 5% of the value of your desired
                        property. So having savings and a good source of income and employment will allow you to pay the
                        deposit and also pay for the rent to the housing association.</p>

                    <p>Otherwise, you need to show that you are a candidate for affordable housing. If you are a
                        financial position to afford your own property then you will not be eligible. For instance, you
                        must have a minimum household income of £60,000 or less otherwise you would probably be able to
                        put down a larger deposit than 5%. You could be a first-time buyer looking to get on the
                        property ladder or perhaps you are currently a homeowner who cannot afford to buy. Other
                        individuals that are eligible are those currently renting from a housing association already but
                        now have enough savings to put down a deposit on a property.</p>

                    <p>To see if you can afford a shared ownership mortgage, <a
                            href="http://www.newlonhomeownership.co.uk/buying-information/mortgage-calculator/"
                            target="_new">you can use a mortgage calculator</a> to enter your income and the value of
                        the property.</p>

                    <h2>Frequently asked questions about shared ownership mortgages</h2>

                    <h3>How is shared ownership mortgage different to a shared equity scheme?</h3>

                    <p>A shared equity scheme is where the mortgage provider offers you a lower interest rate on part of
                        the mortgage that you cannot afford. This is different to a shared ownership mortgage where you
                        pay a small deposit to earn 25-75% but also pay rent to the housing association for the shares
                        that you don’t own.</p>

                    <h3>How do I sell my property?</h3>

                    <p>If you own 100% of the property because you have used staircasing to buy more and more shares,
                        they you can sell the property but the housing association or bank has first option to buy it
                        back, within the first 21 years of the contract. If you do not own 100% of the property, you
                        must ask the housing association for permission if you are looking to sell.</p>

                    <h3>Can I make repairs to the property?</h3>

                    <p>Yes, you will require permission from the housing association or bank. The provider may find that
                        home improvements may add value to the property but needs to check the budget and ensure that
                        the repairs are in the property’s best interests.</p>
