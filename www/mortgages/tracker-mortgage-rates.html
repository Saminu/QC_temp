                        <h2>What is a tracker mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>A tracker mortgage is a mortgage where the interest rate is variable and changes constantly
                            as it tracks another interest rate, usually the <a
                                    href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Documents/rates/baserate.pdf"
                                    target="_new">Bank of England Base Rate</a>. The interest rate you pay is a
                            combination of the tracker deal rate advertised by the lender plus the base rate. So if the
                            tracker deal offers 0.5% interest and the base rate is 2.5%, you will pay 3% interest in
                            total on your mortgage. Tracker mortgages can last for as little as one year or you can have
                            a lifetime tracker mortgage to last the entire length of the mortgage period.</p>

                        <p>The idea of the tracker mortgage is that if Bank of England’s rate goes down, you will
                            benefit and pay less interest on your mortgage. However, if the Bank of England’s rate goes
                            up, then you will have to pay more interest. The graph below shows how the tracker rate
                            follows the base rate.</p>

                        <p>When you sign up for a tracker mortgage, you are given a very low ‘introductory rate’ and
                            when this period ends, you are allocated the standard variable rate (SVR) which his the
                            default rate the lender charges for all variable rate mortgages.</p>

                        <h2>Tracker mortgage advantages</h2>

                        <p>Tracker mortgages are extremely popular and there are several advantages for selecting this
                            type of mortgage. Borrowers will be able to make the most of lower interest rates that
                            become available by tracking the Bank of England rate. This will lead to a saving on the
                            monthly interest they pay for their mortgage until the interest rate goes back up.
                            Homeowners with a fixed mortgage rate are unable to enjoy the same rates.</p>

                        <p>A further advantage is when setting up your tracker mortgage, the arrangement fee you are
                            forced to pay will be typically be lower than what customers pay for a fixed mortgage. In
                            addition, when you sign up, the introductory rate you are given is usually the lowest
                            interest rate you can get for any type of mortgage.</p>

                        <p>Most tracker mortgages allow you to overpay up to 10% of your mortgage balance per year
                            without an early repayment charge (EPC). Mortgage lenders will charge around 2% for early
                            repayments so by avoiding this you can save a few hundred or thousand pounds. This aspect of
                            the tracker mortgage is very helpful to individuals who feel comfortable with their finances
                            or are expecting an injection of cash and can therefore afford to overpay on their mortgage
                            repayments.</p>

                        <p>An additional benefit is that some mortgage lenders offer a ‘Droplock feature.’ This means
                            that if the tracker rate is causing your interest rate to go much higher than expected, the
                            lender will allow you to switch to one of their fixed rate models. It is worth finding out
                            if your mortgage lender offers this because it will allow you to minimize your interest
                            repayments.</p>

                        <h2>Tracker mortgage disadvantages</h2>

                        <p>The main downside of a tracker mortgage is that the base rate can go up and therefore you
                            will be forced to pay a higher monthly mortgage repayment than expected. For this reason, a
                            tracker mortgage is not suitable for an individual who cannot handle an increase in their
                            budget. For those looking for more stability in how much they pay each month, they may be
                            better suited for a fixed rate product which is not subject to fluctuations. Also, once your
                            introductory period ends, you will be placed on the standard variable rate, which can
                            sometimes be much higher and lead to a huge increase in you repayments. A way to avoid this
                            higher rate is to remortgage or arrange a new deal with your lender.</p>

                        <p>A further disadvantage is that sometimes you cannot take advantage of the lowest rates
                            because the lender puts a ‘collar rate’ on it which caps the interest you are charged to a
                            certain level. If you are looking to apply for a tracker mortgage, it is important to see if
                            the provider has a collar rate or not.</p>
