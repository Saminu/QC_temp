                        <h1>First Time Buyer Mortgage</h1>

                        <p>If you’re a first time home buyer, we appreciate that it can be hard to understand
                            all the different steps associated with getting your first mortgage. To make life
                            easier, we explain all the things you need to know about getting a mortgage for
                            first time buyers to help you get on the property ladder.</p>

                        <h2>First Time Buyer Mortgage Explained</h2>

                        <p>A mortgage is a type of loan that you use specifically to buy a property. You will
                            likely borrow the money from a bank or building society and make monthly
                            repayments at a rate that is based on your financial circumstances. The loan is
                            secured meaning that if you are unable to keep up with repayments, your
                            property can be repossessed by the bank and resold.</p>

                        <p>To be eligible for a first time buyer mortgage, you must be a UK resident and be
                            looking to purchase a property in the UK. You must be at least 18 years of age
                            and your mortgage period must end by the time you are 75 years old.</p>
                        <p>
                            To be accepted for a mortgage in the first place is a priority. The first thing you
                            will to do as first buyers is to speak to a mortgage advisor or bank to get a
                            decision in principle. Mortgage lenders want to approve applicants that have a
                            good credit history and employment. This involves showing proof of your
                            identity, credit rating, salary and financial commitments. You are usually asked
                            to produce copies of your passport, water bill, bank statement and pay-slips over
                            the last 3 months.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <h2>First Time Buyer Guide</h2>

                        <p>For first time buyers, knowing what property value you can afford is always very
                            important. This is based largely on how much deposit you can currently
                            contribute towards the property. Fortunately, with impressive first time
                            mortgage buyer schemes from the Government, you can put down as little as 5%
                            or 10% deposit on the property. This means that the Government or the bank
                            can give you the rest of the loan towards your property and this is known as the
                            Loan to Value (LTV).</p>

                        <p>To give an example, if the property you want costs £100,000, you can put down a
                            deposit of 10% which is £10,000. If you can get Loan to Value of 90%, this means
                            that the Government or bank will be willing to lend the 90% outstanding to
                            purchase your property.</p>
                        <p>
                            However, the higher Loan to Value you get, the more you obviously owe to the
                            bank so your monthly rates will be higher to pay off your mortgage.
                        </p>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>How much does a First Time Buyers Mortgage cost?</h2>

                        <p>The monthly interest rate you pay for a first time buyers mortgage will typically
                            range from 2.5% to 5% per month. However, the overall cost of your mortgage
                            will depend on a number of factors including:</p>

                        <p><strong>Your personal circumstances:</strong> Your current credit rating will impact how much
                            you pay. Your credit rating provides insight into how well your have kept up
                            with other payments for loans and credit cards and gives lenders an indication of
                            your debt to income ration.</p>
                        <p>
                            For those with a bad credit history, they may be charged higher rates to cover
                            the risk of default. Good credit histories are seen as a low risk of default and
                            therefore they tend to pay lower premiums.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your income and salary also contributes to the rate you are given. Those
                            individuals with long term employment and show good signs of income growth
                            are more likely to be accepted for mortgages and receive best rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Mortgage Term:</strong> A mortgage can last for up to 40 years but the longer you the
                            mortgage term, the more you end up paying as the interest accumulates over
                            time. The average mortgage term is around 25 years but having a mortgage
                            period of only 5 or 10 years will mean higher monthly payments but less overall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Deposit and Loans to Value:</strong> How much you can deposit towards your property
                            will make a huge impact on the monthly costs moving forward. The higher your
                            deposit, the less Loan to Value you require, so the less you ultimately have to
                            repay to the mortgage provider.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First time buyers have the opportunity to only put down 5% or 10% deposit to
                            get a mortgage. Typical mortgages have a benchmark of around 25% deposit to
                            get a good deal and to get the cheapest first time buyer mortgage rates, you
                            should look to put down as much as 40% deposit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Type of Mortgage:</strong> There are several repayment options when it comes to
                            paying back your mortgage loan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A standard repayment mortgage splits the costs between interest (loan charges)
                            and the capital (value of the property). You can choose to pay an <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/interest-only-mortgages.html">interest only
                            mortgage</a> where you only pay the interest every month and then you have to pay
                            the capital at the end of the mortgage term in one big sum. This is very popular
                            for first time buyers who want to pay as little as possible whilst they are young
                            and repay in full when they have saved more over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/fixed-rate-mortgages.html">fixed mortgage rate</a> means that the interest rate you pay each month is fixed
                            for your entire mortgage term. This is helpful if you like to budget and want to
                            plan exactly how much you pay every month for the foreseeable future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/tracker-mortgage-rates.htm">tracker mortgage</a> changes the rate based on Bank of England base rate. So the
                            interest you pay will go up or down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don’t worry about being tied down to one mortgage agreement for the rest of
                            your life. If you want to move property, you can do so, this is called ‘porting’ –
                            because mortgages are transferable and you can always change your repayment
                            type.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Early Repayments:</strong> You always have the option to repay your mortgage loan
                            early. Since the longer your mortgage is open, the more interest you pay over
                            time, repaying early allows you to save money. However, you must check the
                            terms and conditions of your mortgage agreement as early payment penalties
                            may apply.
                        </p>

                        <h2>First Time Buyer Scheme</h2>
                        <p>Fortunately, there are a lot of first time buyer schemes to help young people in
                            the UK get their first mortgage.</p>
                        <h3>Shared Ownership</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Shared Ownership Scheme means that you part own the property from the
                            Housing Association. You buy shares into the property with a minimum of a 10%
                            deposit and over time you pay rent and you can buy more and more shares, up to
                            100% if you wish.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Help to Buy
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Help to Buy scheme is a very popular scheme in the UK. First time buyers
                            can purchase a property of up to £600,000 with a minimum 5% deposit. The loan
                            is interest free for 20% of the property’s value for 5 years and then is charged at
                            a very low rate of 1.75% and increases year by year. When the house is later
                            resold, the homeowner is required to repay the 20% that was interest free.
                            Another type of Help to Buy loan allows the Government to guarantee any losses
                            on the property’s value.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Equity loan</h3>
                        <p>
                            An Equity Loan means that you need to put down a minimum of a 5% deposit
                            and the Government can contribute another 20% towards your property. You
                            will then need a Loan to Value of 75% from your bank. By having equity in your
                            property, the Government is allowed to receive their investment back and also
                            profit from future sale of the property. <a target="_blank" href="//www.mortgageadvicebureau.com/helptobuyequityloan">See equity loan example</a>.

                            In addition to the deposit and monthly interest rate, other important costs to be
                            aware of include the legal fees involved in creating and approving the mortgage
                            loan agreement. If you are moving into a new home, you will also require home
                            and contents insurance to cover any damaged fittings, structures or items in the
                            house. Above all, the most important additional cost is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/house-buying/stamp-duty-calculator">Stamp Duty</a> which can
                            range from 2% to 12% of the property’s value.
