                    <h2>What is an offset mortgage?</h2>

                    <p>With this type of mortgage you can ‘offset’ your savings to reduce the overall interest that
                        you owe. You simply create a separate account or a little ‘side pot’ and you can put money
                        into this account as you wish. As you put funds into the account, the interest on your
                        mortgage is calculated and it reduces accordingly. So if you top up the account, the
                        interest is less but then as you withdraw money, the interest increases. Ideally, the more
                        money you put into your deposit allows you to lower the cost of your mortgage. It is
                        completely tax-free to put your savings in an offset account and you can access the funds
                        whenever you like free of charge./p>

                    <h2>Offset mortgage payment example </h2>

                    <p>If you have a mortgage for £150,000 but you have £30,000 in savings, an offset mortgage would
                        allow you to only pay interest on £120,000. So this repayment option would reduce the
                        overall cost of your mortgage and allow you to be the full owner of property much
                        sooner. </p>

                    <h2>Offset mortgage – the main advantages</h2>

                    <p>With an offset mortgage, you are able to overpay on your loan without limits or charges.
                        Typical mortgages only allow you to repay up to 10% of your loan each year and there may be
                        a fee for doing so. However, an offset account allows you to continuously add savings to the
                        pot and overpay your mortgage without penalties.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned, an offset account allows you access to the funds whenever you want them. So if
                        you find that you have disposable income, you can add this to the pot. But if you find that
                        you need some extra money for an emergency expense, you are able to withdraw at any point
                        knowing that your money is not locked away.</p>

                    <p>A disadvantage of this mortgage product is that the rates are typically more expensive than
                        your standard mortgage. It also relies on the homeowner having a lot of savings at their
                        disposal in order to make the most of it. If the individual does not have savings that they
                        can constantly top up, they will find themselves paying a higher interest rate and unable to
                        reap the benefits of the offset mortgage.</p>

                    <p>Ways to reduce the offset mortgage rate includes having a very good credit rating. By showing
                        a good history of repaying loans and credit on time, the lender believes that you are a low
                        risk of defaulting. Also putting down a large deposit on the property will allow you to
                        access a better interest rate. The more you can deposit means that you will require a lower
                        loan-to-value (LTV) and you will own a greater share of the property compared to the
                        lender.</p>

                    <h2>Is an offset mortgage right for me?</h2>

                    <p>An offset mortgage could be the right mortgage for you <strong>if you have a lot of
                        savings</strong> available and would prefer to put these towards your mortgage rather than a
                        low return savings account. You are required to pay tax on a savings account but this is not
                        the case with an offset mortgage. Over a long term mortgage such as 25 years, you can make
                        huge savings on tax because instead you will be putting your savings towards your property,
                        which will probably generate a better return than any savings account. You can use this <a

                            mortgage calculator</a> to see whether this type of mortgage would be right for you
                        based on your current financial position.</p>

                    <p>In addition, this type of mortgage can be suitable for those struggling to make their
                        mortgage repayments. This is because <strong>family members are able to contribute to the
                            offset account</strong> in order to help reduce the overall cost of the loan. The
                        savings are still kept in the relative&rsquo;s name and are still accessible at any point.
                        This can significantly reduce the burden on the homeowner and avoid their account going into
                        arrears and the risk of their property being repossessed.</p>

                    <h2>How is an offset mortgage different to a current account mortgage?</h2>

                    <p>A current account mortgage, also known as CAM, puts both your debts and your savings into a
                        single account whereas an offset mortgage is linked to a separate bank account. The two are
                        very similar and both allow the homeowner to reduce interest payments on their mortgage.</p>
