                    <h2>Remortgage – what does it mean?</h2>

                    <p>To remortgage means to switch your current mortgage deal to a new one either with the same or different provider. With the average mortgage term for around 25 years, there are always going to be better rates and options available to homeowners in the UK. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remortgage">To remortgage your property</a> allows you to take advantage of new deals, offers and introductory periods that will allow you to save money over time without having to leave your home.</p>
                    <p>A common reason for remortgaging is because the introductory period on your existing property is no longer applicable. The introductory period usually lasts for two to five years and offers a lower interest rate as an incentive for new customers. Once this initial period is over, homeowners are put on the mortgage providers’ standard variable rate (SVR), which could be around 5% but this much higher than the average interest rate. To avoid paying a higher rate, property owners try to switch to better deals and this is commonly known as ‘remortgaging.’</p>

                    <h2>Remortgaging – what are the advantages?</h2>

                    <p>The main advantage of remortgaging is that  you can reduce your monthly repayments by <strong>switching  to a better deal</strong>. The idea is to find a mortgage from your existing or new  provider that has a better rate and introductory period. If you can switch from  paying 5% per month to 3%, you could save hundreds or thousands of pounds a  year. </p>
                    <p>Since the Bank of England base rate has  been 0.5% since 2009, you could realistically move your mortgage deal from a  higher rate to a lower one. With such stability, homeowners can take advantage  of <a href="https://quiddicompare.co.uk/mortgages/tracker-mortgage-rates.html">tracker  mortgages with low rates</a>.  Also,  property owners may find that they have been able to save money over the last few  years and would now like to try use that saved money to lower their monthly  interest repayments through an <a href="https://quiddicompare.co.uk/mortgages/offset-mortgage-rates.html">offset  mortgage</a>. </p>
                    <p>If you wish to <strong>repay your mortgage early</strong>, there are always early repayment fees  that apply. However, a new remortgage deal may allow you to overpay earlier  than your existing deal and for less. </p>
                    <p>Remortgaging is common to <strong>consolidate your debts</strong>. Getting a  mortgage is like getting a big loan secured on your home. So if you have a lot  of outstanding loans and credit card bills, you can remortgage to borrow more  money to pay off your debts. The rate you pay on a mortgage is much cheaper  than what is charged for personal loans and credit cards, which is why many see  remortgaging as a viable option for raising capital. If you plan to remortgage  for debt consolidation, it is important to follow a strict plan to clear your  bills and not be tempted to run up more debt.</p>
                    <p>But the simplest thing about remortgaging  is that you <strong>don&rsquo;t have to move home</strong>.  You can continue to own or live in your premises and there is no need to move  out or change address.</p>
                    <h2>Use our Remortgage  Calculator to see how much you could save</h2>

                    <p>A remortgage calculator is essential when  deciding whether or not to remortgage. The sums are very important when its  come down to it because you need to know if switching mortgages is more  cost-effective. There are always costs for getting a new mortgage deal such as  arrangement fees, legal fees, valuation costs and set up costs amongst others.  Therefore it is a matter of doing the maths to see if you would be better off  switching and this is why using a remortgage calculator is vital.</p>

                        Some partners may charge you a fee for helping you find a Mortgage or Secured Loan or other services they provide. MAKE SURE you check with the company before agreeing to any service if they charge you a fee and what the terms are.<br>
