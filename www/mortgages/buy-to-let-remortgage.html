                        <p>A Buy to Let Remortgage refers to changing your existing buy to let mortgage
                            mortgage with a new deal either from a new or existing provider. <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/buy-to-let-mortgage.html">Buy to let
                            mortgages</a> are specifically for landlords who purchase a property and pursue a
                            return on investment by renting it out to tenants.</p>
                        <p>
                            The reason for getting a Buy to Let Remortgage is commonly to find a better deal.
                            Most mortgages start with an introductory deal, which offers a discount rate for
                            the first 3 to 5 years. But when this period expires, the interest rate charged
                            moves to the standard variable rate (<a target="_blank" href="//moneyfacts.co.uk/guides/mortgages/what-is-a-standard-variable-rate">SVR</a>) which is higher than the average
                            interest rate. Therefore, getting a new deal or ‘remortgage’ can help you save
                            money by paying better interest rates.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Buy to Let Remortgage – What are the advantages?</h2>

                        <p>
                            The most popular reason for getting a Buy to Let Remortgage is to take
                            advantage of better deals available. Mortgages are transferrable so can easily be
                            moved to another product with the same company or a different provider. This
                            includes taking advantage of introductory periods and other bonuses such as
                            cash back and nectar points.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whilst most Buy to Let mortgages are interest only, if your existing arrangement
                            is a <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/fixed-rate-mortgages.html">fixed rate</a> or <a target="_blank" href="/mortgages/tracker-mortgage-rates.html">tracker mortgage</a> that rely on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1607881/When-UK-rates-rise.html">Bank of England base rate</a> and
                            this rate falls, you will certainly save money by switching mortgages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re a landlord looking to consolidate your debts or raise capital to perhaps
                            invest further in the property, the rates you pay on a mortgage are potentially
                            less in the long run that what you would pay for other personal loans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, if you wish to repay your mortgage early but find that you have an
                            early repayment clause in your mortgage agreement, remortgaging may allow
                            you to repay earlier and cost you less for doing so.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Buy to Let Remortgage – am I eligible?</h2>

                        <p>To be eligible for a Buy to Let Remortgage, you must obviously have an existing
                            Buy to Let Mortgage in place. Landlords are limited to a maximum of 3 buy to let
                            mortgages and you cannot borrow more than £2 million in total.</p>

                        <p>By Remortgaging, you are essentially applying for a new loan and your financial
                            circumstances may have changed since you applied for your first hand mortgage.
                            Therefore, to be eligible, mortgage providers will need to review your credit
                            rating and how well you have been paying your existing mortgage. If you have a
                            poor record of keeping up with mortgage repayments, you may not be eligible
                            for a remortgage or you may have to pay a higher interest rate to manage the
                            risk of default.</p>
                        <p>
                            Also, the mortgage lender will need to assess the rent you currently receive from
                            tenants and also expected rent. This will play a role into how much you can
                            borrow and what your Loan to Value (LTV) will be.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Important information about Buy to Let Remortgaging</h3>

                        <p>For a Buy to Let Remortgage, it is uncommon to receive a Loan to Value (LTV) of
                            more than 75% as the best deals typically provide a maximum of 60% LTV or
                            less. This means that you need to have at least 40% deposit of the property’s
                            value.</p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to remortgaging, you really need to think about the costs involved
                            with getting a new mortgage. Whilst there are savings to be made by switching to
                            a cheaper deal, you really need to weigh this up with the other costs. For
                            instance, there are extra fees involved with getting a remortgage such as legal
                            and survey fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking these costs into consideration, you need to think about your long-term
                            investment as a landlord. You will need to think about what will happen if you do
                            not receive rent or if the value of property depreciates over time and how this
                            will affect your bottom line.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, if you are unable to keep up with the Buy to Let Remortgage repayments
                            over a long period of time, your property can be at risk of repossession.
