                        <h1>Right to Buy Mortgage</h1>

                        <p>A Right to Buy Mortgage refers to giving council and housing association tenants
                            the opportunity to buy their house at a discount rate. Right to Buy is a hot topic
                            in the news and many believe it has been beneficial for the UK economy allowing
                            price houses to rise and council tenants to own a tangible asset.</p>
                        <p>
                            The idea behind the discount is that every time an additional home is sold, a new
                            affordable house will be built to manage the waiting list of affordable housing. If
                            the tenants who accept this discount wish to sell their property within five years,
                            part or all of the discount will be repaid to the Government.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How much is the Right to Buy Discount</h2>

                        <p>The Right to Buy Discount depends on the how long you have been a tenant with
                            the public sector, the type of property, the value of your property and your
                            personal financial circumstances. However, the maximum right to buy discount
                            you can receive is 60% of the properties market value which is equivalent to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><h4>£100,000 in London (£75,000 in the rest of England)</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>£16,000 in Wales</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>£24,000 in Northern Ireland</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>Not applicable in Scotland (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/14/contents/enacted">read more</a>)</h4></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You are still required to get a Right to Buy Mortgage from a bank or building
                            society and make monthly repayments – the only difference is that the value of
                            the property is heavily discounted which makes your mortgage much cheaper
                            than normal. Some mortgage lenders may be satisfied having equity in your
                            home, so you won’t have to put down a deposit. This means that if you sell the

                        <h3>The costs involved with a Right to Buy Mortgage</h3>

                        <p>Although you are receiving a potentially huge discount on your property, there
                            are still costs involved like with any mortgage. For instance, you will have to pay
                            stamp duty which can range from 2% to 12% depending on your property’s
                            value. Also, there are standard legal fees and the cost of a surveyor which you
                            have to budget for.</p>

                        <p>As part of the Right to Buy Scheme, you may be required to pay maintenance fees
                            like ground rent and service charges or contribute to any repairs or
                            improvements to the common areas.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately you have to try take this extra costs into consideration and whether
                            you can afford to take on a Right to Buy Mortgage even with the discount in
                            place. Failing to keep up with mortgage repayments and other ongoing costs can
                            cause debt problems and for your property to be repossessed.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Selling your home after the Right to Buy Scheme</h3>

                        <p>If you wish to sell your council home within 5 years of accepting the Right to Buy
                            Scheme, you will have to repay part or the entire discount. The discount becomes
                            less and less for the longer you remain in the property.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><h4>80% of the discount in the second year</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>60% of the discount in the third year</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>40% of the discount in the fourth year</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>20% of the discount in the fifth year</h4></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            If you bought your home after the start of January 2005, the regulation states
                            that your council has the right to refuse you selling your home for 10 years.
