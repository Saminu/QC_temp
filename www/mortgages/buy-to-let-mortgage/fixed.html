                        <h2>Fixed Buy to Let Mortgage</h2>

                        <p>A fixed buy to let mortgage is a mortgage specifically for a landlord to buy a property

                            and rent it out to the public but the interest rate they pay for their mortgage is fixed. A

                            fixed interest rate means that your monthly payment will not change during your

                            mortgage term of 3,5, 25 or 40 years.</p>
                        <p>
                            The main advantage of agreeing to this fixed rate is that you could potentially save

                            money if the <a href="//www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/repo.as">Bank of England Base Rate</a> decides to increase, meaning that other types of

                            repayment options such as a <a href="../../mortgages/tracker-mortgage-rates.htm">tracker mortgage</a> or <a href="../../mortgages/interest-only-mortgages.htm">interest only mortgage</a> could be more

                            expensive. Above all, having a fixed rate every year allows landlords to budget and plan

                            their finances effectively.
                        </p>


                        <h2>Fixed Buy to Let Mortgages – what interest rate will I pay?</h2>

                        <p>The interest rate that the landlord is charged for their mortgage will largely depend on

                            their credit score and employment status. Those applicants with a good credit score and

                            a good flow of income will usually be able to obtain the best rates of interest. By

                            comparison, if you have a bad credit score and your income is not steady, you will may

                            not be able to access to the lowest interest rates because you are a greater risk of

                            default.</p>

                        <h2>How much can I borrow from a Fixed Buy to Let Mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>How much you can borrow from a mortgage provider will depend on how much you can

                            deposit. The more you deposit on the property, the less you need to borrow in the form

                            of a mortgage. The loan-to-value (LTV) refers to how much you need to borrow as a

                            value of the mortgage. So if you put down a deposit of 25% of the property’s value, you

                            will need a loan-to-value of 75%. Typically, the highest loan-to-value percentages are

                            usually available to those with the best credit.</p>
                        <h2>Am I eligible for a Fixed Buy to Let Mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>To be eligible for a fixed buy to let mortgage, you must follow the criteria below:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><h4>- be over 21 years of age but younger than 80</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>- have a minimum annual income of £25,000</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>- no more than 3 buy to let mortgages per person</h4></li>
                            <li><h4>- cannot borrow more than £2 million</h4></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>The advantages of a Fixed Buy to Let Mortgage (H2)</h2>

                        <p>There are numerous benefits to taking out a fixed buy to let mortgage package:</p>
                        <h3>Payments are Predetermined</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rather than having to constantly check current interest rates, a fixed buy to let

                            mortgage gives you the safely of ensuring that what you pay never changes over the

                            agreed period. Therefore, no matter how much interest rates may increase by or

                            fluctuate, you are always protected.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Easier to Plan Ahead</h3>
                        <p>With a fixed rate buy to let mortgage, you are afforded the luxury of being able to plan

                            ahead. You can work out how much you will have to pay over the agreed period and set

                            aside a lump sum of money to help you cover those costs. This would not be possible if

                            your payments were subject to interest rates and fluctuations. This is particularly

                            helpful for landlords who have to factor in the cost of replacing household items or a

                            loss of rent.</p>
                        <h3>Financial Security</h3>
                        <p>Having to keep the property occupied is difficult enough without having to worry about

                            how much you will need to pay should it become vacant. With a fixed buy to let

                            mortgage, you will be able to look ahead and evaluate just how much money will be

                            needed each month in case the tenants leave the property and leave you short of the

                            income generated.</p>

                        <h2>Useful Information</h2>
                        <p>Before applying, please take note of the arrangement fees charged by mortgage lenders

                            which may range from £1,000 to £3,000. This includes arrangement fees, valuation fees

                            and solicitor fees.</p>
                        <p>When purchasing your property, consider how much it may cost to fix up the place such

                            as new walls, floors, paintwork and white goods. You do not want to be in a position

                            where you overspend because failing to keep up with mortgage repayments may cause

                            a negative impact to your credit score and repossession of the estate.</p>
                        <p>Finally, consider the area where you are buying the property and whether it will sustain

                            its value. A buy to let mortgage is a long term investment and you want to ensure that

                            you will be able to continue to charge rent at a profitable rate and potentially resell the

                            property for more than you bought it.</p>
