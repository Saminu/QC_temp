                        <h2>Tracker Buy to Let Mortgages</h2>

                        <p>Tracker buy to let mortgages allow you buy a property and rent it out to the public but

                            the interest rate you pay is tracked to the Bank of England Base Rate. So part of the

                            interest rate you pay is the lender’s rate and the other part is the Bank of England rate.

                            By tracking your rate, it means that if the base rate falls, which it has in recent years,

                            your interest rate will fall too. However, this also means that if you the base rate

                            increases, the interest rate you pay on your mortgage will increase too, leading to higher

                            monthly payments.</p>
                        <p>
                            Tracker buy to let mortgages are typically used by property investors and landlords to

                            renovate a property and rent it to tenants for profit. Since the mortgage is used to raise

                            capital, a <a href="../../mortgages/buy-to-let-mortgage.html">buy to let mortgage</a> is typically for investment purposes and landlords hope

                            that the property will increase in value over time and can be sold at a higher amount.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A tracker buy to let mortgage pays both the capital (the cost of the property) and the

                            interest rate (charged by the lender). This payment method is different to other

                            mortgage options. For instance, an interest only buy to let mortgage means that you pay

                            just the interest on your mortgage loan and then repay the capital at the end of the

                            mortgage term. A <a href="../../mortgages/buy-to-let-mortgage/fixed.html">fixed buy to let mortgage</a> means that the interest rate you are given

                            remains fixed during your entire mortgage term so you can plan exactly what you are

                            going to be paying in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Tracker Buy to Let Mortgages - What determines my interest rate?</h2>

                        <p>A buy to let mortgage will normally incur different and often higher fees than a standard

                            mortgage, as lenders understand that the mortgage loan required is not for a first home,

                            but for investment purposes.</p>
                        <p>The rate and amount you will pay each month are dependent upon various factors:</p>
                        <p><strong>Interest rates </strong>- As interest rates fluctuate, so too does the overall cost of the mortgage.

                            The interest rates that change are the Bank of England Base Rate and this usually

                            reflects the current state of the economy. There is also the interest rate charged by the

                            lender and this will depend on your income and credit score.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Income</strong>–Buy to let mortgages take into account the income of the property owner. It is

                            the yearly salary of the landlord which helps set the value of the entire mortgage. Most

                            buy to let mortgages will be worth over 3 – 4 times the salary of the person taking out

                            the loan.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Credit Score</strong>– Mortgage providers will look at your credit history and how well you

                            have paid other loans and mortgages in the past and consider your debt-to-loan ratio.

                            Those borrowers with the best credit ratings are usually able to receive lower interest

                            rates because they have a lower risk of default.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Rent fees </strong>– Lenders will look at the amount of rent that you can potentially charge for

                            your property. The rent charged is usually 125% of the mortgage so that the borrower

                            pays 100% of their mortgage and that extra 25% is profit. So lenders try to calculate

                            this taking into account the size of the property and the area it is in.
                        </p>



                        <h2>The advantages of a Tracker Buy to Let Mortgage</h2>
                        <p>The benefits of a tracker buy to let mortgage include the possibility of your interest rate

                            falling if the base rate falls too. This will mean lower monthly mortgage repayments and

                            more disposable income.</p>

                        <p>
                            Most of the companies we work with are able to offer ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introductory_rate">introductory periods</a>’ which

                            mean that you receive a discount on your interest rate for the first few years of your

                            agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unlike other buy to let mortgage schemes which tie you in to set payments no matter

                            what, tracker buy to let mortgages give you the option of changing to a cheaper fixed

                            alternative should interest rates rise and should you change your mind and decide to fix

                            your repayments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arrangement fees are typically lower for tracker mortgage rates than other fixed or

                            interest only mortgages. You can also make early repayments to pay off your mortgage

                            early if you have extra income – although there may be fees for doing so.
                        </p>

                            property to the public.</p>

                            the tenants that do not pay rent.
