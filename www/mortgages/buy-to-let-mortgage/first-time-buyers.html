                        <h2>Buy to Let Mortgages for First Time Buyers</h2>

                        <p>As a first time buyer, acquiring buy to let mortgages can be difficult and there are many

                            hurdles in the way of securing that much needed loan. Lenders will typically carry out

                            affordability checks through which they will look at your earnings and what you are

                            likely to earn over the period of the proposed mortgage. The higher one’s earning

                            potential, the more likely it will be to secure the loan needed as the loan itself will not be

                            worth more than 3 – 4 times the applicant’s salary.</p>


                        <h2>Buy To Let Criteria – Who is eligible?</h2>

                        <p>Also, while experienced landlords may get the better deals, a first time buyer can also

                            get a good interest rate provided they have a good credit history. It is also important

                            that first time buyers understand the fees associated with buy to let mortgages and the

                            risks involved.</p>
                        <h2>First Time Buy to Let Mortgages: How much can I borrow?</h2>
                        <p>A ‘normal’ mortgage’s value is usually linked to the household income against the value

                            of the property, which allows for affordable payments. However, a buy to let mortgage

                            is normally allowed to be around 3 – 4 times the salary of the landlord. For example, if

                            the landlord’s annual salary is £50,000, they will be allowed to take out a mortgage of

                            up to the value of £150,000 over a particular period of time.</p>

                        <p>
                            Different buy to let mortgages providers will vary how much they lend. Buy to let

                            mortgages, unlike home mortgages also take into account the amount of rent that will

                            likely be earned from the property. To estimate the value, many landlords will ask an

                            experienced letting agent for an assessment of the property and its earning potential in

                            comparison to similar local properties. Having a property in a good area can be key to

                            seeing a positive return on investment.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Fees Involved With Buy to Let Mortgages</h2>

                        <p>Inevitably there are various different fees that should be taken into account when

                            looking to apply for a first time mortgage. Most fees will need to be paid before you are

                            awarded the buy to let mortgage loan:</p>
                        <h3>Arrangement Fees</h3>
                        <p>
                            Arrangement fees are required by every lender at some point during the process of

                            securing your buy to let mortgage. While there are lenders who will only ask for these

                            fees once the loan has completed, there are many lenders who require it as an upfront

                            cost, in case the loan doesn’t go through. These fees are therefore often paid as part of

                            the initial application for the mortgage itself. Arrangement fees are typically 1-2% of the

                            total loan fee up to mortgages worth £1 million.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Valuation Fees</h3>
                        <p>
                            As the mortgage is dependent upon the value of the property, the property needs to be

                            valued by a professional. A valuation will normally require an extensive report on the

                            property and can cost more than £500. Since residential buy to let properties do not

                            require the surveyor to visit them in the way that commercial properties do, their

                            valuation fees are usually cheaper.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Legal Fees</h3>
                        <p>In order to ensure the application process is legally sound and adheres to UK laws

                            surrounding buy to let mortgages and their repayments, a solicitor will be required to

                            look over all documentation and the terms of the contract between you and the lender.

                            As the potential proprietor, you should expect to have to cover not only your own legal

                            costs, but also those of the lender, which together, could cost more than £1,500.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The risks of a First Time Buy to Let Mortgage</h2>

                        <p>The biggest risk of your first buy to let mortgage is that you don’t keep a track of your

                            costs and you fall into arrears. The interest rates for buy to let mortgages are typically

                            higher than a standard mortgage. Failing to keep up with mortgage repayments can lead

                            to a negative impact on your credit score and your property may be repossessed by the

                            mortgage provider to cover their costs.</p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to monthly mortgage repayments, you may also need extra money to do up

                            the property. Most people apply for a buy to let mortgage because they want to renovate

                            an existing property which they can rent out or resell for more. As a new property you

                            may need to pay for new walls, floors, kitchen, bathroom, paintwork, mattresses and

                            more. So as a first time buyer, you have to weigh up the additional costs for redoing the

                            property and the ongoing maintenance. If you are charging rent to tenants, you want to

                            ensure that everything works and as a landlord, you will need to cover the costs of

                            broken white goods, electrical products and alterations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to charge rent to tenants in order to generate revenue, you will typically

                            charge 125% of your mortgage, so that the extra 25% is profit. However, a risk to

                            consider is if tenants don’t pay and how this will lead to a loss of income. As a landlord,

                            you can get insurance to cover the cost of lost income and you can always request a

                            deposit when the tenant moves in. We recommend finding good tenants beforehand and

                            you can always check their credit score to see how well they have made other

                            repayments in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With all these risks into consideration, the best thing you can do as a first time buyer

                            looking for a buy to let mortgage is to buy a property in a good area. If the property can

                            maintain its value or increase in price overtime because the area is up and coming, you

                            can therefore charge more rent or sell it for more than you bought.
