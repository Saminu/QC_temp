                    <h1> Mortgage Glossary</h1>

                    <p>There are so many different types of mortgages and each come with their own terminology so it is
                        important to understand all the lingo. In order to compare mortgages effectively, you need to be
                        able to tell the difference between a base rate and a fixed rate and understand an early repayment
                        fee from an arrangement fee. So to make life easier, we’ve put together a very simple mortgage
                        jargon buster so you can understand all the key terms before applying.</p>

                    <h3>Mortgage Terminology</h3>

                    <p><strong>APR:</strong> This is the Annual Percentage Rate and is the official yardstick for comparing
                        all financial products. The APR is useful for mortgages because it calculates the interest and fees
                        specifically on an annual basis and this is relevant to compare the cost of mortgages that last for
                        25 years and onwards.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arrangement Fee:</strong> The booking fee you pay to a broker or loan company for securing
                        your mortgage offer. The arrangement fee can sometimes be very expensive so it is important to
                        factor this into the cost of your entire loan.</p>

                    <p><strong>Arrears:</strong> A customer who has defaulted on their mortgage repayments falls ‘into
                        arrears’ and this may lead to extra charges, a negative impact on their credit score and possible
                        repossession of their property.</p>

                    <p><strong>Base Rate:</strong> This is the rate determined by the Bank of England. This is relevant for
                        if you have a tracker mortgage, the fee you pay will be tracking the base rate whether it goes up or
                        down. In total, you will pay the base rate + the interest from the lender.</p>

                    <p><strong>Booking Fee:</strong> Similar to the arrangement fee, it is the cost of setting up the loan
                        by the broker or lender.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bridging Loan:</strong> A type of loan you can get to help you pay between moving house or
                        getting a new mortgage. The term is used to ‘bridge’ the gap in between payments.</p>

                    <p><strong>Buy to Let:</strong> A mortgage specifically for landlords to buy a property and rent it out
                        to the public. The interest rates are typically higher than your standard mortgage. The rent charged
                        is usually 125% of the mortgage payments to allow the landlord to cover the cost and make a profit.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Capital:</strong> The amount you borrow for your mortgage in order to buy a property.</p>

                    <p><strong>Capital Gains Tax:</strong> If you have a buy to let mortgage and are able to sell your
                        property for a profit, you will pay a tax known as Capital Gains Tax.</p>

                    <p><strong>Collar Rate:</strong> If you have a tracker mortgage and the interest you pay goes up and
                        down because of the base rate, some lenders will put a collar rate into place which means that the
                        rate is capped and cannot go below a certain level.</p>

                    <p><strong>Credit Rating:</strong> An individual score awarded on the basis of how well you have paid
                        other loans and credit in the past. A good or bad credit rating can impact how successful your
                        mortgage application is and what rate you pay.</p>

                    <p><strong>Decision in Principle:</strong> When applying for a mortgage, successful candidates will be
                        given a decision in principle stating how much they can afford to borrow from a mortgage. Decision
                        in principles can expire and can be renewed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Deposit:</strong> The sum of money that you put down towards your property. The rest of the
                        money needed to purchase the property will come from your mortgage. A minimum of 10% is required for
                        your deposit. The more you deposit initially, the lower your monthly repayments will be as you will
                        be owning more of the property.</p>

                    <p><strong>Early Repayment Charge:</strong> Also known as EPC, some lenders will charge around 2% for
                        early repayments of your mortgage. If you have less than three months left on your mortgage, the EPC
                        may not apply depending on the lender.</p>

                    <p><strong>Equity:</strong> This is the stake or amount of the property that you own.</p>

                    <p><strong>First Time Buyer:</strong> Those individuals that have never had a mortgage or owned a
                        property before. First time buyers may have access to better rates and can take advantage of
                        government schemes in order to get on the property ladder.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fixed Rate Mortgage:</strong> The rate you pay on the mortgage does not change during the
                        mortgage period and remains constant throughout. Homeowners hope that by paying a fixed rate, they
                        will save money long term because they won’t be subject to fluctuations. Fixed rates also provide
                        security as individuals can budget how much they are going to pay on their mortgage each month with
                        complete certainty.</p>

                    <p><strong>Flexible Mortgage:</strong> Individuals can make extra payments if they have disposable
                        income and this will reduce the outstanding balance. The flexibility also allows homeowners to
                        reduce monthly payments easily and also take payment holidays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interest:</strong> This is the monthly fees charged by mortgage lenders and is the easiest
                        way to compare the cost. Mortgages are available with variable interest, fixed interest, interest
                        free and more.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interest Only Mortgage:</strong> Borrowers only pay the interest on their mortgages and no
                        capital initially. This is the cheapest repayment option and most affordable way to own a property.
                        Very popular amongst first time buyers, borrowers must recuperate the cost by repaying the entire
                        capital in one large lump sum repayment at the end of the mortgage term.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mortgage Term:</strong> The length of the mortgage and is on average around 25 years but can
                        be much longer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Offset Mortgage:</strong> Homeowners can use their savings in order to reduce their monthly
                        repayments. Lenders will look at your bank account or those linked to your bank account which could
                        be from your parents or spouse. Provided that you have savings available, the outstanding balance
                        will be reduced. For example, if you have a £100,000 mortgage but have £20,000 in savings, you will
                        only be expected to pay £80,000.</p>

                    <p><strong>Overpayments:</strong> Lenders will typically allow customers to overpay on their mortgage by
                        around 10% each year. Common for those with disposable income or who get a bonus from work or some
                        inheritance, overpaying will cause the outstanding balance to decrease.</p>

                    <p><strong>Payment Holiday:</strong> The period where you make no payments on your mortgage. If you are
                        having trouble repaying or you have a flexible mortgage, you are able to miss out a few monthly
                        repayments. However, the interest will continue to be charged during this period.</p>

                    <p><strong>Remortgaging:</strong> Getting a new mortgage on top of your old one without moving home.
                        Homeowners remortgage in order to get better rates from other types of products or to raise finance.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Repayment Mortgage:</strong> The most common mortgage repayment. This involves a combination
                        of paying off interest and capital until the end of the mortgage term and you will own the property
                        once repaid in full.</p>

                    <p><strong>Repossession:</strong> As a result of missed payment, the property is taken away from the
                        borrower and put in the hands of the bank that may sell it on the open market to cover the cost of
                        the mortgage.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shortfall Debt:</strong> The money that you owe if your house is repossessed by the bank and
                        sold for less than the amount of your outstanding balance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Standard Variable Rate:</strong> Also known as the SVR, this is usually the higher mortgage
                        rate charged by lenders once a borrower has finished an introductory period for fixed, tracker or
                        mortgage deal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tracker Mortgage:</strong> The borrower pays a rate that is tracking the base rate of the
                        Bank of England. If the base rate falls, borrowers will enjoy a lower interest rate.</p>
