                        <h2>What is a buy to let mortgage and how does it work?</h2>

                        <p>A buy to let mortgage is for people to looking to buy a property and rent it out to the
                            public for a
                            profit. Typical for landlords and property investors, the idea of building a house or flat
                            and
                            fixing it up and renting it out poses a good investment opportunity where the demand for
                            rented
                            accommodation is the UK is growing rapidly. There is a lot of interest from young
                            professionals for
                            rented accommodation as the cost for first time buyers has increased over time. With this in
                            mind,
                            several opportunists all over the country have opted in to buying properties through buy to
                            let
                            mortgage schemes.</p>

                        <h2>How is a buy to let mortgage different from a regular mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>Buy to let mortgages are all about buying the property and renting it out to tenants. The
                            mortgage
                            rates therefore are assessed largely on the rental income you will receive. The idea is that
                            landlords will charge around 125% of their mortgage fees in rent to the tenant – meaning
                            that the
                            landlord should make a profit of around 25%. When it comes to deposits, a buy to let
                            mortgage
                            requires at least 25% of the property value up front to proceed. Naturally, the more you
                            deposit,
                            the better interest rate you will receive but overall the interest rates for buy to let
                            mortgages
                            are higher than you typical mortgage.</p>

                        <p>The payment structure of a buy to let mortgage is similar to a regular repayment mortgage.
                            Borrowers
                            are expected to make monthly repayments of capital and interest and the mortgages are
                            available in
                            interest only, tracker and fixed rate as discussed below:</p>

                        <h2>Types of buy to let mortgages</h2>

                        <p><strong>interest only – </strong>most buy to let mortgages are interest only although they
                            also come
                            in the form of fixed and tracker. The reason that they are mostly interest only is because
                            this is
                            the most affordable way to pay for a mortgage in the short term since you are paying just
                            the
                            interest and no capital initially. It gives the landlord the option to pay the full capital
                            at the
                            end of the mortgage term or change to a different mortgage repayment plan later on. There is
                            the
                            added bonus of being able to offset the mortgage repayment against your tax bill.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fixed – </strong>This is less common for buy to let mortgages but is still available
                            and this
                            involves having the same fixed interest rate throughout the entire mortgage period. The rate
                            will
                            not change unless the type of mortgage is changed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tracker – </strong>This is also less common for buy to let mortgages and involves
                            putting the
                            interest rate on a tracker with the Bank of England base rate. The interest rate will
                            therefore
                            fluctuate regularly and landlords may have to pay higher or lower interest rates as a
                            result. </p>

                        <h2>Am I eligible for a buy to let mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>The criteria for a buy to let mortgage requires the landlord to be over 25 years of age and
                            the
                            mortgage period must end when that individual reaches the age of 75. Borrowers are limited
                            to 3 buy
                            to let mortgages at any given point and the maximum they are allowed to borrow in total is
                            £2
                            million. The landlord must also have a minimum income of £25,000 per year. If you are
                            wondering if I
                            can get a buy to let mortgage based on my credit score, lenders tend to favour those with
                            good
                            credit ratings. Underwriters will look at how well you have paid other mortgage repayments
                            in the
                            past and if you have any outstanding debt from credit cards and loans. Those borrowers with
                            bad
                            credit may still be eligible for a buy to let mortgage but this will be reflected with a
                            higher
                            monthly interest rate.</p>

                        <h2>Things to consider when applying for a buy to let mortgage </h2>

                        <p>The <strong>arrangement fees</strong> are higher for buy to let mortgages and range from
                            £1,000 to
                            £3,500. This is an extra cost to take into consideration before proceeding. It is worth
                            shopping
                            around for the best providers in order to save on the arrangement cost.</p>

                        <p>It is also important to think about the <strong>return of investment</strong> if you have to
                            pay
                            monthly mortgage repayments and to fix up the property. A good way to ensure a return on
                            investment
                            is to carefully select the area that you are buying the property to see if there is a demand
                            for
                            rented accommodation and if the estate will maintain its value. It can be useful to look at
                            previous
                            price values of that area and forecasts for the next few years. Ideally, you want to invest
                            in a
                            property in an area that is thriving and will see a growth in value.</p>

                        <p>Doing your maths is important to assess whether or not you will make a return on a buy to let
                            mortgage. One must consider alternatives such as <a

                                lending</a> which may offer better rates of return and much less stress. </p>

                        <p>Finally, if you plan to sell your property as an exit strategy, is it important to factor in
                            the cost
                            of capital gains tax, which will apply if you sell the property for a profit. As a business
                            opportunity, it is important to do all the calculations before committing to a buy to let
                            mortgage.

                        <h3>Risks of buy to let mortgages </h3>

                        <p>There are risks associated with a buy to let mortgage which borrowers must be aware of before
                            applying. For instance, landlords will be responsible to collecting rent from their tenants
                            in order
                            to fund their mortgage. If tenants do not pay their rent, the landlord will be expected to
                            cover the
                            cost of the mortgage and his may lead to financial difficulty. With this mind, it is
                            essential for
                            landlords to carefully select their tenants and monitor the repayments carefully.</p>

                        <p>In addition, landlords must consider the possibility of their property’s value depreciating.
                            If the
                            value of the estate goes down over time, landlords may have to charge less rent or they
                            won’t be
                            able to sell the property for as much as they like and this will lead to lower return on
                            investment.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the most important thing to remember before committing to a long-term mortgage is
                            that if a
                            borrower fails to meet repayment, it could lead to a repossession of the property.
                            Furthermore, the
                            individual may incur further charges and have a negative impact on their credit rating and
                            this will
                            make it harder and more expensive to access credit and finance in the future.</p>
