                    <h2>What is a credit score and how it works</h2>

                    <p>A credit score is a numerical value that indicates an individual’s credit

                        worthiness. This number is calculated by the three main credit reference

                        agencies: Experian, Equifax and CallCredit. Every time you apply for a financial

                        product, miss or make a repayment, the information is sent from the lender to

                        one of the credit bureaus who update your score up or down accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The idea of a credit score is so that potential lenders are able to tell quickly

                        whether or not you will be a good person to lend to and what rate you should be

                        charged. For lenders that have a certain criteria, they can benchmark a specific

                        credit score and anything below this will not be eligible. Lenders will also use a

                        credit score to determine how much they should lend to a customer and at what

                        rate of interest.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Reasons for checking your credit score</h2>

                    <p>
                        Individuals with better credit scores are entitled to more favourable rates of

                        interest because they are deemed at less risk of default. Especially for those

                        applying for a mortgage, having a high credit score can get you a more

                        competitive interest rate which can save you thousands of pounds over time.

                        For this reason, UK consumers like to check their credit score regularly to ensure

                        they maintain a high score and can get the best deals on all credit cards and

                        loans.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        People check their credit score when looking to build credit. If you have a poor

                        payment history, you can rebuild your credit score by making a number of

                        payments on time. So for those looking at a big purchase such as a car or a house,

                        they will check their score regularly so that they can apply when their rating is at

                        its highest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On a similar note, since you receive your credit score when you are 18 years of

                        age, you may not be eligible for certain loans because you have a limited credit

                        history. Therefore, as a young person, you may decide to obtain small levels of

                        credit such as credit cards and constantly monitor your score in order to build

                        up credit.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Credit score range  - what the credit score numbers mean</h2>
                    <p>
                        Credit scores are divided up in five categories: very poor (0 - 560), poor (561 -

                        720), fair (721 - 880), good (881 - 960) and excellent (961 - 999),<a target="_blank" href="/www.experian.co.uk/consumer/experian-credit-score.html"> according to

                        Experian</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good credit score in the UK is 881 and above. This suggests that you have a

                        good credit history or repaying your debts on your time and this should entitle

                        you to favourable rates of interest for mortgages and credit cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The average credit score in the UK is 783 and this is categorized as fair. <a target="_blank" href="//www.creditgeeks.co.uk/credit-score/what-is-a-good-credit-score">The

                        average credit score</a> suggests that you may have a lot of credit open at the

                        moment and have a history of missing and also making repayments on your

                        loans and credit card bills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A bad credit score is any number under 720 and may be due to a number of

                        reasons. For example, one’s credit score is likely to depreciate after missing

                        consecutive monthly repayments for things like your mortgage, personal loans

                        and credit card bills. Bad credit scores are likely to be common for those that

                        have experienced bankruptcy or a County Court Judgment. Customers find a fall

                        in their credit scores if they have made a number of loan applications in a short

                        space of time, making them seem financially squeezed or if they have a large debt

                        to income ratio.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is a credit score made up of?</h3>
                    <p>Your credit score is made up of the following:</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>35% - Payment History:</strong> This refers to how well you have kept up with bills in

                        the past including loans, cards and mortgages. If you have defaulted on loans or

                        your account is in arrears, your credit score will be affected negatively as a

                        result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>30% - How much you owe:</strong> This considers how much is outstanding to your

                        creditors. If you are on top of your repayments, you will have a good credit score

                        to reflect this. However, your score may suffer by 30% if you have a lot of debt

                        outstanding, overdrafts and numerous loans and credit cards open.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>15% - Credit length:</strong> The longer you have had credit and a good history of

                        repaying, the better. If you have old accounts that are still active, you will be

                        rewarded in your credit score. It can also be beneficial to close any unused

                        accounts such as a store cards that you haven’t used in years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <strong> 10% - New searches:</strong> Any application you make with a lender is recorded on

                        your credit report. The lender leaves a ‘footprint’ to signal that it has checked

                        your account. This tells other lenders that you have applied for other sources of

                        finance. Therefore, if you have made numerous applications in a short space of

                        time, it will impact your credit score it may turn off lenders who think that you

                        are desperate for funds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>10% - Types of credit:</strong> Some forms of credit are more positive for your credit

                        score than others. Having a mortgage suggests that you are a good candidate to

                        lend to because to be approved, you have to demonstrate a good history of

                        credit. By comparison, high risk and high cost loans may lower your credit score

                        as a sign that you could not find affordable credit elsewhere.
