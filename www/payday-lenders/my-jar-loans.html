                        <h2>How Does The Application With My Jar Work?</h2>
                        <p>
                            You start by completing the application form online and providing details about

                            yourself including your address, employment, income and bank details. My Jar

                            will run a number of checks on your account to see if you can afford to repay the

                            amount you wish to borrow. They will also run a credit check to see how well

                            you have paid previous loans in the past and if you have any major debt

                            outstanding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your application was successful, you will be sent a text message to your phone.

                            In the final stages of the application, you will need to sign the loan agreement

                            online using the pin sent to you in the text message. Once verified, a further

                            phone call maybe required to confirm a few details and My Jar may request

                            additional verification documents from you such as a bank statement or a pay-

                            slip. If your application is completely approved, the funds will be transferred to

                            your debit account in 15 minutes in one lump sum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, to be eligible for a loan, you must have a working mobile phone and

                            debit account so that the funds can be sent to you. You will also need to be over

                            18 years of age, a UK resident and in employment with a regular income of at

                            least £400 per month.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Do Repayments Work With My Jar Loans?</h2>
                        <p>
                            A My Jar loan is repaid in monthly instalments and collected automatically from

                            your debit card using continuous payment authority. Upon applying, your debit

                            card is tokenized by My Jar who can collect repayments from your account each

                            month in a smooth way to save you the hassle. You have the option to login to the

                            ‘My Account’ section of the website where can always repay manually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have the disposable income and wish to repay your loan early, you can do

                            so. Since the repayment amounts are calculated on a daily interest, it will always

                            be cheaper to repay your loan early. To pay your loan early, you can login online,

                            call up My Jar or send a text to the company to clear your account.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any late repayments will incur additional fees. A standard default charge of £15

                            applies for any late repayments each month provided that the balance is still

                            outstanding 3 days after the due date.
                        </p>
