                        <p>Peachy are registered as Cash on Go Ltd and are one of the biggest payday

                            lenders in the UK. The Manchester-based firm offers customers from £50 up to

                            £700 which can be repaid over 15 days up to 12 months. You can therefore take

                            out a Peachy loan as a payday loan and repay on your next pay date, or you can

                            use it as an instalment loan and repay over a number of months.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How Can I Apply with Peachy Loans?</h2>

                        <p>You can apply for a Peachy Loan through this page and you will be taken directly

                            to their website. Peachy offer a completely online application which can be made

                            on their safe and secure website as they do not have a storefront where you can

                            apply. As a direct lender, you fill in your details online, they will process your

                            application and if successful, they will transfer the funds to your debit account in

                            one lump sum around 15 minutes after approval. There are no brokers,

                            intermediaries or upfront fees for applying.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Upon filling in your basic information such as how much you wish to borrow,

                            how long for, your address, employment, income and bank details, Peachy will

                            run a series of checks on your account. Using your income, they will determine

                            whether you can afford to repay the amount you wish to borrow. In addition,

                            there will be credit checks carried out to see your repayment history of other

                            loans and how much credit you have outstanding. Where possible, Peachy will

                            avoid contacting your employer. If successful, you will receive an activation

                            email to complete and the funds will be on their way.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What is The Criteria For A Peachy Loan?</h2>
                        <p>To be eligible for a loan with Peachy, you must have the following criteria:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Must be 18 or over</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Be a UK resident</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Hold a UK bank or building society account with a valid debit card</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Have a mobile phone & email address</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Must have regular monthly income of at least £600 (some benefits may be included)</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A valid debit account is important because this is where your funds will be sent

                            to if successful and where your repayments will be collected from. A mobile

                            phone and email address is essential so Peachy can contact you at any time and

                            also so you can verify your loan before it is funded.</p>
                        <h2>How Can You Repay Your Peachy Loan?</h2>

                        <p>
                            You can choose to repay your Peachy loan in one lump sum or in monthly

                            instalments. If you loan is only for a few days or weeks due to a short-term

                            emergency expense, repaying in one lump sum is an easy way to clear your

                            account. For a long-term expense, repaying in 3,6 or 12 monthly instalments

                            gives you the flexibility to spread repayments over time with smaller amounts

                            each month. You will receive email and text messages on the days leading up to

                            each repayment date so you know what to expect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is a representative payment example: Borrow £250.00 for 3 months (91

                            days). Repay in 3 payments. Each payment: £126.48. Total repayment: £379.44.

                            Interest: £129.44. Interest p.a: 292.25% (fixed). Representative 1255.66%APR
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Peachy, you have the option to repay early at any point and since you are

                            charged a daily interest rate, you only pay interest for the number of days you

                            have had the loan open for – so its always cheaper to repay early.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Payments are usually carried out through a process known as continuous

                            payment authority. This refers to how your debit card is tokenized by Peachy

                            upon application so when your repayment date is due, your collections are

                            automatically taken from your debit account by Peachy to ensure a smooth

                            process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you wish to pay manually, you can do so by logging into your Peachy account,

                            texting them, bank transfer or paying in cash at a Paypoint terminal.
                        </p>
