                        <h1>Sunny Loans </h1>

                        <p>London-based Sunny Loans is one of the fastest growing lenders in the UK at the

                            moment. Operated by Elevate Credit International Limited, customers can

                            borrow between £100 and £2,500 and have the option to borrow over 6 or 14

                            months and repay early at any time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sunny are a direct lender that functions completely online so you can visit their

                            website and apply for funds. Your loan can be approved within 15 minutes of

                            making an application and your funds can be transferred to your bank account in

                            one lump sum, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Sunny Loans – How Are They Different To Other Lenders </h2>
                        <p>
                            Sunny offer two very distinct loan products. The main product allows you to

                            borrow between £100 and £950 but the minimum period is 6 months, although

                            you can repay early at any point and it will be cheaper to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is a representative payment example: Loan amount £400 repayable

                            over 6 months. Total amount repayable £752.24 in 6 payments of £125.38.

                            Interest 292% p.a.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second product is known as ‘Sunny Plus’ and allows customers to borrow

                            between £1,000 and £2,500 for a 14-month period but again borrowers can

                            repay early at any time. Since the amount you pay is calculated as a daily interest

                            rate, the less time you have the loan open for, the less you pay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sunny therefore gives you the option for a short term or long-term loan and you

                            have the flexibility to repay in monthly instalments and spread your repayments

                            over time. This is a lot easier than a payday loan which requires you to repay the

                            entire loan and interest in one lump sum on your next payday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sunny also offer a unique ‘5 day cooling-off period’ so if you decide after 5 days

                            that you no longer want you loan, you can request a refund and you will not be

                            charged anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another unique selling point is that Sunny customers are able to have up to 3

                            active loans open at any time, provided that they meet the standard credit and

                            affordability checks.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Sunny Loans – What is the Criteria?</h2>
                        <p>
                            To be eligible for a Sunny loan, customers must be at least 18 years old, living in

                            the UK, have a working bank account, mobile phone and debit card. Customers

                            must have a net income of at least £500 per month and be in full-time or part-

                            time employment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A mobile phone is required so Sunny can get hold of you and also because you

                            need to verify your loan by text. A debit card is essential because this is where

                            your funds are transferred and your repayments are collected.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Checks Carried Out By Sunny Loans</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since the entire application is processed online, Sunny will request your

                            employer details, sort code and account number and your address history for the

                            last three years. Applicants will be asked to provide details of their income and

                            expenditure and any current financial obligations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to most competitive payday lenders, customers will be put through credit

                            checks so Sunny can get an idea of your repayment history, debt to loan ratio and

                            how many other loans you have open.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Based on this information above, Sunny will be able to decide whether you are

                            eligible for a loan and also determine how much you are able to borrow.
                        </p>
