                        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan" target="_new">A mortgage is a type of
                            loan</a> used to buy new property or for existing property owners to raise funds for any
                            purpose. The monthly loan repayments allow individuals to pay for their property for an
                            extended
                            period, usually around 25 years, until they clear their payments and have full ownership of
                            the
                            property. Mortgage rates are offered by banks, credit unions and building societies and the
                            loans are secured against the property so the provider is able to repossess the estate if
                            the
                            borrower defaults on repayment or does not abide by the terms of the agreement.

                        <h2>Cheap mortgages – how can you find them?</h2>

                        <p>Cheap mortgages will depend on which provider offers the lowest interest rate. To find the
                            cheapest mortgage, borrowers need to decide whether to select a mortgage at a fixed rate or
                            a
                            variable rate. A fixed rate means that the interest will stay the same throughout the entire
                            mortgage period whereas a variable rate means that the rate you pay will change based on
                            economic factors such as inflation and bank rates. By having a variable rate, it means that
                            you
                            could be paying less for your mortgage than if you were with a fixed rate but it can also
                            mean
                            that you might pay more.</p>

                        <p>Mortgage rates are presented in the form of APR, which stands for the annual percentage rate
                            and
                            allows you to compare mortgage rates easily. The annual calculation considers the fact that
                            mortgages last a number of years and the rate is compared on an annual basis. The average
                            mortgage lasts for around 25 years with the option to choose a longer or shorter period of
                            time.
                            By having a longer mortgage deal, it will consist of cheap repayments spread out over a long
                            period of time. The shorter the term, the sooner you will be able to clear the mortgage
                            payments
                            completely and have ownership of the property. For this reason, you need to compare price in
                            order to find the best short-term mortgages that you can afford.</p>

                        <h2>How much can I borrow for a mortgage?</h2>

                        <p>How much you can borrow for a mortgage loan requires you to look at the LTV (loan to value).
                            The
                            LTV typically ranges from 60% - 90% and refers to how much of the property value the
                            mortgage
                            provider can lend you. To give an example, if you are looking to borrow a property worth
                            £100,000 and the LTV is 75%, you will have to make a down payment of 25% of the value
                            (£25,000)
                            and the provider will lend you the remaining 75%. You will need to assess your finances and
                            affordability to determine how much LTV you need. Borrowers are encouraged to use mortgage
                            loan
                            calculators to find out how much LTV they require and what monthly payments they can afford
                            moving forward. It is also advisable to have the property valued and appraised again to
                            confirm
                            the value of the estate because going ahead.</p>

                        <p>In addition, how much you can borrow will depend on your personal circumstances and
                            eligibility
                            for a mortgage. If you application is approved, you will be given a ‘decision in principle’
                            and
                            this confirms how much you are able to borrow. How successful your mortgage application is,
                            the
                            interest rates you are charged and the LTV will depend on the following:</p>

                        <p><strong>Higher deposits – </strong>The higher deposit you are able to make, the better
                            interest
                            rate you will likely be offered because you own will more of the property than the average
                            customer. For instance, if you were put around 40% of the property value up front, you will
                            only
                            require a 60% mortgage and may be eligible for one of the lowest rates.</p>

                        <p><strong>Credit History – </strong>mortgage underwriters will look carefully are your credit
                            history upon offering you a decision in principle. How well you have paid other loans and
                            forms
                            of credit in the past will impact the success of your application and the LTV you are
                            offered.
                            Underwriters will also look at whether you have had other mortgages in the past and how well
                            you
                            have made your repayments. Other credit related factors that may affect the success of your
                            application include whether you have ever been bankrupt or had an IVA or CCJ. There are
                            mortgages for bad credit available but this will usually involve higher interest rates and
                            lower
                            a LTV. For more information, you can <a

                        <p><strong>Employment – </strong>mortgage providers will take your employment into perspective
                            when
                            making a decision. Positive things that will help your application include being in
                            employment
                            for a long period of time and how long you have been with the company and your growth in
                            salary
                            over the years.</p>

                        <p><strong>Debt to income – </strong>part of the mortgage application involves understanding
                            your
                            level of income and expenditure to income more carefully. Underwriters will usually require
                            copies of your pay-slips and bank statements in order to get a better idea of how much you
                            earn
                            and what you spend your money on. Before granting a decision in principle, mortgage
                            companies
                            need to ensure that you are able to afford the monthly repayments.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mortgage Schemes – </strong>depending on your type of employment, you may be eligible
                            for
                            schemes to help you get a mortgage such as <a
                                    href="https://www.gov.uk/affordable-home-ownership-schemes/overview" target="_new">affordable
                                housing</a>, help to buy schemes and credit unions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Economic factors – </strong>the state of the economy will also have an impact on
                            whether
                            you are successful with your mortgage application. A good economy encourages the banks to
                            lend
                            out money at generous LTVs whereas a struggling economy causes banks to be more cautious
                            over
                            whom they lend to and the loan to value they allocate.</p>

                        <h3>Beware of added fees</h3>

                        <p>To save money on your mortgage before you apply, it is important to be aware of early
                            repayment
                            <strong>charges</strong>. It’s great if you are able to repay your mortgage early but many
                            companies charge an early repayment charge (EPC) of around 2% for doing so.
                            It is important to consider how long you plan to be at the new estate prior to agreeing the
                            mortgage. If you think that you are going to move after 5 years and you are confident with
                            your
                            level of income and expenditure, it would be worth selecting a five-year product rather than
                            locking yourself in for much longer.</p>

                        <p>There are additional set-up fees involved with getting a mortgage. Mortgage brokers and
                            lenders
                            will typically charge a <strong>booking fee</strong> for getting a quote for you and
                            reserving
                            it. The second is an <strong>arrangement fee</strong>, which is paid to the broker or
                            provider
                            on the completion of the mortgage. The way around these fees is to only proceed if you
                            believe
                            you are getting the best rate possible. If could be worth getting a higher interest rate
                            with a
                            lower booking fee or it could be better getting a lower interest rate with a higher booking
                            fee.
                            It is important to speak to the provider about your options before going ahead and ensure
                            that
                            you take these extra costs into account.</p>
