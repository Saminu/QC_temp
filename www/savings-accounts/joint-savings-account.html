                <p>Joint savings accounts are one of the most common types of savings accounts and offer a simple way to
                    manage the money you share with a partner or housemate and are ideal for paying bills, writing
                    cheques and withdrawing cash.</p>

                <h2>What is a joint savings account?</h2>

                <p>A joint savings account is very similar to a regular savings account. You are required to regularly
                    deposit money into the account and you are paid interest on what save. However, the only difference
                    is that instead of one person putting money into the account, there are two or more people making
                    deposits. This means that decisions and responsibilities on matters relating to the account are
                    shared.</p>

                <h2>Who typically uses a Joint Savings Account?</h2>

                <p>The most common type of people who open joint savings accounts are couples and those people that live
                    in the same property such as housemates. Married couples, civil partners and co-habiting couples
                    often use a joint savings account to manage their savings. It also makes sense that couples that put
                    their income in one pot are able to put their savings together too. In addition, housemates
                    frequently open joint savings accounts too as a way of managing and paying bills.</p>

                <p>People who use savings account generally have disposable income and they want to put their funds in a
                    safe place and earn some interest on their savings.</p>

                <h2>How do I open a joint savings account?</h2>

                <p>When you apply for a joint savings account, the bank will usually expect you to provide certain
                    information. All potential account holders will be asked to fill in essential information on an
                    application form whether in a branch or online.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All parties will be required to provide proof of address and proof of identity.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>If any of the account holders are able to take or deposit savings without the permission of the
                        other account holders.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>If minimum deposits are required. Certain accounts offering the high interest rates make you
                        deposit a minimum amount each month. If you do not meet these payments then your savings may be
                        subject to a much lower interest rate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information on how disputes between different joint account holders will be settled.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the account holders are happy with these terms then they will then sign a mandate, a formal
                        agreement that will formally open the account.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What are the benefits of a joint savings account?</h2>

                <p>The biggest benefit of a joint savings account is that it offers a straightforward way of organizing
                    your savings and finances. You know that if you have to pay your water, gas and electricity bills
                    each month that you can deposit money in to your joint account and enable a smooth payment
                    process.</p>

                <p>A joint savings account can prevent couples from arguing about money because they can both make
                    deposits and access their savings.</p>

                <h2>What are the risks of opening a joint savings account?</h2>

                <p>The worst thing about a joint savings account is the risk involved in sharing the account with
                    someone else. It is unlikely that you will be able to stop other account holders from withdrawing
                    savings. This situation may arise with cash-strapped housemates, which is why it is essential to
                    trust other account holders.</p>

                <p>Account holders also give up a bit of privacy when they share their finances with other individuals.
                    Other parties will be able to access information on transactions you make on the account. For this
                    reason, it may be best to deposit money purely for bills that you are sharing and not for your own
                    personal spending.</p>

                <h2>What to do if disagreements happen between different account holders?</h2>

                <p>One of the risks you take on when opening a joint bank account is the fact that disagreements may
                    develop between different account holders. If this happens there is usually a formal process that
                    will help decide how the remaining money in the account is to be split.</p>

                <p>Firstly, you can ask your bank to cancel the mandate. This freezes the account so nobody can access
                    or deposit new funds into the account.</p>

                <p>The next best thing to do is for the different account holders to try and resolve the issue between
                    them. If you are able to do this then the bank can arrange to divide the funds in the way that you
                    have agreed.</p>

                <h3>Is there any protection for customers?</h3>

                <p>The <a href="http://www.fscs.org.uk/" target="_new">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a> offers
                    protection for the money you put in a joint account if the bank or building society goes bankrupt.
                    If the customers have up to £85,000 in their savings account, the scheme will allow them to recover
                    their funds.</p>
