                            borrow from £100 to £20,000 and repay over 5 months to 3 years in

                        <h2>The advantages of borrowing from a Long Term Lender</h2>

                        <p>By borrowing from a long-term lender, you have the flexibility to

                            make smaller repayments over a long period of time and the

                            convenience to repay early at any time if you want to. This is much

                            more practical than borrowing <a href="//paydayloans.quiddicompare.co.uk">payday loans</a> where you are required

                            to repay the full loan and interest on your next pay date. By

                            staggering repayments over time, you can manage your finances with

                            less stress hanging over your head.</p>

                        <p>
                            Long-term lenders are perfect for large expenses and purchases such

                            as weddings, new cars and home improvements. For instance, you

                            could borrow up to £20,000 to renovate your kitchen or extend your

                            home and end up making a greater return on investment when you

                            sell your property.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For emergency purposes such as a funeral or burst water pipe, it can

                            be very hard to pay thousands of pounds upfront – so having the

                            option to repay a loan over a number of years makes perfect financial

                            sense.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How much can you borrow with a Long Term Loan Lender? </h2>

                        <p>The amount you can borrow with a long-term loan lender will

                            depend on your personal finances. Those applicants with higher

                            salaries are able to borrow more and as they can afford higher

                            monthly payments. Lenders will tend to run a credit check on your

                            account and those with a good credit history and record of repaying

                            loans on time will likely have greater access to funds.</p>


                        <p>Furthermore, whether you decide to opt for a secured or unsecured

                            loan will affect how much you can borrow. Despite the greater risk, a

                            secured loan on your property or vehicle can allow you to borrow the

                            maximum amounts offered by long-term lenders.</p>
                        <h3>How we select our Long Term Lenders</h3>

                        <p>We carefully review all the lenders we work with to ensure that they

                            treat customers fairly, follow the regulatory guidelines and are

                            actively approving loans. We frequently change the lenders we

                            feature and add new lenders too in order to provide the best quality

                            and loan products available.</p>


                        <p>The majority of lenders we feature are direct lenders meaning that

                            you can apply directly on their website and the funds are transferred

                            by this company. We will clearly state any brokers that we work with

                            who will request your details to find the best loan product for you.</p>
